Log Date: 5/29/2010
I think the cache has gone missing.  May have washed away, not sure.  Hopefully it can be replaced and we will get to visit again someday.

Log Date: 5/29/2010
I noticed someone else logged the same day and found it (mp, we must have been on the same circuit, I saw your name on two moves too same day!), they found it but listed it needed maintenance. We did not find it after the 3 of us searched for it for a good long while. Final cache for the day (#8 of 8) so we were very disappointed not to go 100% for the day. Great day anyway, kids and I had a lot of fun!

We scared a goose near the point, a snake scared us as we were searching, we watched a beaver swim across the lake but we didn't find the cache.  WILL SEARCH AGAIN LATER,

Searching for an Illinois cache for today and thought we had this one but we didn't find it.  After using the phone a friend option, I think this one is missing.  Will try later but for now I'm off to find another Illinois cache.  THANKS

Out caching with Atomic Goat's Breath and Old Professor in AGB's boat on this beautiful Memorial Day Saturday, doing a little boat caching on Mark Twain Lake finding some of the harder caches to get by land.  
We looked high and low for this one but in the end we could not find it.  :(

Out caching with Atomic Goat's Breath and Old Professor in AGB's boat on this beautiful Memorial Day Saturday, doing a little boat caching on Mark Twain Lake finding some of the harder caches to get by land.  We spent a lot of time here but could not come up with this one.  It seemed like an unusual place for the nearby cemetary.  TNLN SL TFTC!

Since we were in the area, we decided to look for this one even though it's not been found for awhile. When we got near GZ, there were lots of spots that could hide a cooing cache. Alas, we couldn't scare the cache up! Please let us know if this one is elusive - or if it's gone missing. Thanks!

Hmm ... is there a prize for the first to DNF. If there is, we just got it!

We were in the right area and looked for about 30 minutes ... but came up empty. Not sure if we missed it or if it's missing. Either way, no joy for us.

Out with the family after a wedding reception.  Didn't realize the rating on this one until we got near it, but we figured we would give it a try.  After about 20 minutes, we still hadn't come up with the cache.  The kids were getting a little crazy and I was getting hot, so we decided to pack it in.  Perhaps we will be back.

I guess this shouldn't have been a problem, but we had on luck with it.  We found the one with a similar name down the street and figured this would be much the same.  But after searching, what we thought were the appropriate places, according to the GPSr, we still could not find it.  We hope to be back and make the grab some day.  Thanks anyway.

Our only DNF for the day.  And the area in which this cache should have been is a good example of why you shouldn't wear shorts when caching.  Itchweed!  And probably poison ivy in a few days.....    Looked all over the place, in every potential hiding spot with no luck.  Did find an interesting drinking fountain amidst the overgrowth, but no smiley for us.

I was out for a cache maintenance run in Forest Park & this cache was missing. I just happened to have a spare so I replaced it nearby. If anybody finds the first one, please let me know. I'll update the hint also.

My college roommate was visiting but didn't have appropriate shoes to search for this one. I found part of it but no log or container. Don't know if I needed to look more or if this has been partially muggled. My friend went back to cooler shade so I didn't stay too long to search. Another time.

Whacked through some high grass to get to GZ and didn't even find the cache. I wish I'd read old logs before, because it seems the coords are 40 or 50 ft. off. Here's some coords someone posted in a previous log so they're closer to the top: 
N 38 54.186 W 091 34.632. Maybe I'll return at some point. Visited the cache which was cool. Found two ticks on me about 20 minutes later, which was not cool.

We were up at Mark Twain Lake this weekend doing some cache maintenance. We both looked for this one, but came up empty. Found a likely hiding spot, but no container.

We were up at Mark Twain Lake this weekend doing some cache maintenance. I jumped out to get this one, but all I found was a rock. Maybe next time.

Down in St. Louis to visit family over the Memorial Day Weekend.  Took a day to cache in Florissant where we lived for 15 years before moving to Wisconsin (before geocaching).  As we suspected we discovered places "new to us."  The Voodoo was put in its present place of honor after we moved.  Well, this cache turned out to be a challenge for us and we could not come up with the find.  We searched a long time...really wanted to find this one.  Thanks though it was a very interesting hide.

Very frustrating, looked for a long time without finding it.  Very beautiful spot with fun on the rope swing but we will need to try again.  Thanks for showing us a part of the area we would never have noticed otherwise!

Add us to the recent DNF list.  We have found three other cooing caches and presumed we knew what to look for, but did not have any luck ...

This trail is beautiful, especially at the low point with the bridge and little stream.  It is a pretty steep trail, especially with the 3 and 5 year olds in tow.  We ran into a bunch of thorny brush and decided to give up about 100 feet away.  Wish it would have been closer to the trail.  Maybe we will try again in the winter.

Forester Al couldn't find California Redwood (Traditional Cache) at 5/31/2010

Log Date: 5/31/2010
Alright, I just hate logging did not finds.  Found the tree, found the plaque.  Searched high and low.  Just when I was about to give up, a neighbor comes up and says it is right there and points.  We look, and find nothing.  We left disappointed.  I loved the tree though.

Loved the area, kids had a great time playing but we couldn't find the cache.  We were a little hesitant due to poison ivy and creepy crawly things.

Out with Mrs RGS on a quite day in the park. About 1/3 of the logs are DNF's, so I guess that's the group I'm in. Looked and climbed around underneath with a flashlight but no luck. I'll be back on a little cooler day.

I guess I should have checked all the logs before even trying to find this one.  Have tried twice on my own, and been with gorillagal when she looked at least once. The first time I tried (March) there were too many muggles around.  This time, I looked and looked where the coordinates seem to place it, but all I saw, too, was the big pile of excess concrete that was apparently dumped right close to where the cache is supposed to be. I'm guessing, too, that maybe it is covered up now.

Trampled through the thorns with my daughter. Thank you, for taking the fun out of this father daughter outing. Kid friendly should be taken off and high potential for personal injury should be added.

It sure sounds like some contractor was not very responsible. A large pile of cement right on the cache.

I would hope that there are some consequences for the violator of the system.
 
Hopefully someone else will pick this location up and get another cache going.

The ponds are so nasty that we didn't even want to get near them. The City of Quincy should be ashamed by the lack of maintenance to that part of the park!!! Gnats swarming and the smell about knocked us over, the ducks werent even there it's so bad!!

Well, this was a second try to find this cache, and I have to admit to being befuddled.  With most of the logs saying you need someone 6 feet tall, I could not find anything within 50 feet of the coords that was remotely near 6 feet high to reach.  So....I guess I have to ask for help.  HELP !!!   :)   I look forward to actually finding this one.

Hint didn't help at all, and just couldn't find it.  Interesting site, though, and watching the birds take baths in the fountain was a joy!

Looked and looked and LOOKED and couldn't come up with it.  Sure enjoyed our visit to the Soulard area, and even stopped at the Farmer's Market, though it was pretty deserted on a Sunday afternoon.

Sorry Crowesfeat30, I gave up on this one.  It was hot and muggy.  The vegetation was very dense and was actually painful on my bare legs.  I couldn't find a good cachers' trail and I needed a dnf after a busy morning.  I grabbed it here.

Took a look for this cache today but didn't find.  The gazebo looks like it has seen better days.  The rails on the backside have been dismantled and are currently stacked up waiting for repair.  Looked where we thought the cache should be, but came up empty.  Wondering if it is still there?  This cach may need some maintenance. [?]

We took a pretty good look around and didn't come up with it.  After reading the past logs, if it's where we now think it is, we think it's higher than a 1.0/1.5 difficulty!  We'll probably try again on some future trip to Columbia...

This one has thwarted me twice now.  I know it's there, just too dense to get the clue...  will have to go back when I have another 1/2 hour to blow [:)]

Ran out of time as I had to get back to get the kids from track practice.  Spent about 30 mins searching.  Found the decoy but no cache.  Will have to hit it again next week.  I'll get you my kitty (and your little dog, too!) [}:)]

Well, you "stumped" us on this one or should I say "brought us to our knees?"  We did not have our information with us as it was so close from GC21JKA and we did not realize that until we were walking back to where we parked.  I'm thinking we could have found it if we had your hint...there were lots of "knees" there.  Thanks for bringing us to this peaceful spot we had never been this way before.  TFTC

Out caching on the 6th anniversary of breaking my ankle while geocaching.
