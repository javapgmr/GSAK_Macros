# This script for GSAK generates pretty statistics about a Geocachers finds.   # 
# Many different type of statistics can be generated as the user has the       # 
# option to freely choose which should be included.                            # 
#                                                                              # 
# Two types of output are available, with and without shaded image bars on the # 
# graphs.  Although the version with the shaded bars is 'nicer', the version   # 
# without can be pasted directly in the Geocaching.com profile page. Once the  # 
# macro has finished running the clipboard is loaded with the code ready for   # 
# pasting into your GC.com Profile.                                            # 
#                                                                              # 
# The user can chose to exclude locationless caches from the 'Finds by         # 
# Distance', 'Map' blocks and 'Total Distance' figures.                        #

# Version History:                                                             # 
# v0.1 Initial release to GSAK Beta testers                                    # 
# v0.2 MANY changes and additions made, too many to list.  The biggest change  # 
#      was the use of inline STYLE tags rather than a STYLE block in the HEAD  # 
#      section.  This was to allow use in the geocaching.com profile without   # 
#      the need for hosted images.                                             # 
# v0.3 Amended by Lignumaqua 3-21-07. Reversed year order (newest at the top)  # 
#      Fixed statistics for current year to allow for days in year to date.    # 
#      Added checking and creation if necessary of html folder                 # 
#      Added Milestones section and new associated user option                 # 
#      Added simple Form for user entry with choices saved to a disk file      # 
# v0.4 Bug Fixes - Lignumaqua                                                  # 
# v0.5 Complete form, new format for Milestones, options for sections          # 
#      Added total distance to numbers - Lignumaqua                            # 
# v0.6 Added option to use current sort order for Milestones instead of        # 
#      the log ID order. Also restores sort order correctly.                   # 
#      Default milestones sort now uses Log Date and then Log ID within that.  # 
#      Form position set to default to center of screen 3-24-07                # 
# v0.7 Added Color choices, Selectable order of sections, milestones sort      # 
#      runs much quicker. 3-25-07                                              # 
# V0.8 Release candidate. Menu height reduced to fit 800 x 600 display         # 
#      Grey color option added, Total stats added to Numbers section           #
