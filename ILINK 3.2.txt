Hi Stephen,

My name is Shaila Shaikh.  I am writing you in regards to some software Terry Shaikh purchased from you or from MPH software.  My clents have been have a lot of trouble using the software consistantly.  The software crashes frequently, freezes, the FTP and modem setting reset and a few other errors that defeat the purpose of us promoting this as easy to use.  At this time I feel that this software is unstable in the new windows ME & 2000 (WIN 98) environment and we would like and update.  Please call me at 312-870-5445 as soon as possible so we can take care of this.

Regards,

Shaila Shaikh
