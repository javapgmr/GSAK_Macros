Log: 10/07/2005: The virtual that this cache replaced was my first logged cache, so I was glad to go back and find a good solid one. I still love this area. Went off in the right direction without much trouble but the trees were really screwing up the GPSer today.  Tried climbing the cliff in a spot because of the screwed up coordinates I was getting.  Finally turned off the GPSer and turned it back on and it gave me decent enough coordinates to find it.  It is still hidden pretty well though.  Great cache.

Log: 11/05/2005: Neat Cache.  I initially didn't exactly follow the instructions and ended up going toward a spot northwest of where I needed.  I gotta remember to count words when I'm supposed to and letters when I'm supposed to.  Once I got it right, I found the final destination with no problems.  The GPSr's coordinates (both my Garmin and my Magellan) are off a bit but with perserverance and a bit of help, I found it.  The caretaker working there is worth taking the time to talk to. He know the area and the sites very well! 

There is a lot of history in this area that most of us don't know.  TN, left GOOHF card and Calling Card, SL.  TFTC.

It took me a while to find this one but I finally did and took both old wet log books and left a new one sealed in two ziploc bags.

Log: 09/08/2005: I've been watching this cache for a while to see what would happen. Since no one has logged anything since May, I figured that missing cache container was keeping everyone away. The dead duck is gone. I've replace the cache container and log book with one a bit bigger and hopefully a bit more waterproof. I didn't have a pencil that would fit so you'll have to bring your own. The plaque was definite worth reading.  TN, left calling card and GOOHF card, SL.  Thanks for the cache.  Requested answers are on the way.

One of the hottest nights of the summer so far and we had in excess of 90 cachers in attendance.  It was good to see old friends and finally be able to put a face to some of the names that I've been seeing in the logs.  I'd like to express a big 'Thank you' to everyone who took time out to attend the event tonight.  I hope everyone had a good time.  I guess we're due for a three-peat next year, that is, if anyone is interested.
