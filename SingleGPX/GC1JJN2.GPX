&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;The Harry Potter Series consists of 7
different caches, 6 of which have a clue to the final Harry Potter
Cache. Inside each cache will be a student's name that you will
need. The formula to find the Harry Potter cache is also hidden in
one of the 6 caches.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Hagrid is the Keeper of Keys and Grounds and the gamekeeper at
Hogwarts. Starting in Harry's third year, Hagrid taught the Care of
Magical Creatures class. Later, it is revealed that Hagrid is also
a member of the Order of the Phoenix. Hagrid was the first member
of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began
attending the school. He delivered Harry, when he was a baby, to
the Dursleys using a flying motorcycle that once belonged to Sirius
Black. He also fetched Harry for his first year at Hogwarts when
the Dursleys tried to hide him. He was also one of the first
characters to imply that the idea of thinking of wizards as
“pure-bloods” and “half-bloods” is a dated concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4" color="blue"&gt;The above coordinates will take you
to the Forbidden Forest where Hagrid hid his keys. Find these keys
and they will open a way to the final.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;WARNING: This cache is hidden in one of
Hogwarts' Forbidden Forests. In this forest you may encounter one
or more of the following creatures and deadly plants: spiders,
snakes, unicorns, devils snare, thorns, multi-legged creatures,
wolves, deer, flying animals of all types, grappling vines,
mosquitoes, and centaurs. Keep alert at all times and always have
your wand at the ready.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

NOTICE: Please be respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter
the park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you
can be ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching
in the parks in
jeopardy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Special permission to hide caches in St. Louis County parks is NOT
needed as long as the Groundspeak rules are followed. "Blanket
Permission" has been worked out in advance with the park service.
DO NOT CALL THE PARK as they cannot handle the calls. The
Groundspeak cache reviewer does need to know exactly how and where
the caches are hidden and what type of containers are used. The
geocaching liaisons will notify the park service of new caches.
Remember NO AMMO BOXES or PVC PIPE
caches.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn't disappointed in round two as it is still a great, or maybe even better series. Cut across the field since it looked dry and was on the upper end. How many deer are there in this area? Took some stumbling around for WP 1 and then onto the final. I think this one may be here awhile.

This was a very windy walk blowing against me today so it was nice to finally get off the path. It took a few minutes to find WP1 as everything there matched the hint. From there is was a short walk to the final and spotted the cache. I bet that will hold up nicely in the spring floods. Then back to the car and the wind was still blowing against me. 

Thanks for the SE series. Next trip I can hit the other part of the park.
