<h3>Installation notes:</h3>
<p>
  Macro and support file/folder installation:
   the macro code should be installed on your computer in the place where your 
   other GSAK macros are stored. GSAK expects that to be in a "Macro" folder within
   application data folder. Data related to this macro are located in the folder
   ...\Data\Macros\Challenge and the macro output files can be found there.
<p>
  To install: same procedure as any other GSAK macro (see GSAK help file)
    The macro is completely self-contained.
<p>
  If your favorite Challenge Cache is not part of this macro, then contact me (Hynr) 
  through the GSAK forum, indicating interest in having a particular challenge added.
  If you can find any gpx, kml, doc, xls etc data that holds the information for 
  the rectangular polygon regions, then send that to me. I have ways of processing it
  into the data needed in the macro.
<p>
  To modify the macro yourself to include another Challenge Cache: Study the 
  USERdata section at the end of this macro to see how it is done. It requires 
  coding up a subroutine, adding a variable declaration, and a <data> block. Note
  that each challenge has a unique code (called the "ChallengeCode") that starts 
  with Q or D (the type of challenge) an underscore character followed by a 
  short abbreviation.  E.g. D_AL (DeLorme Challenge for Alabama)
<p>    1. Find the <data> <enddata> block at the end where the challenge-specific
data are located.
<p>    2. Find the data element that starts with <data> VarName=$ChalAvail
       Add a line for your state with this format (comma separated):
         ChallengeCode, GC code, Challange name, State name
<p>    3. You also need a <data> variable that contains, a line for each rectangular
       area and the name of the region (or page). This is done with 4 numbers and 
       and some text. The 4 numbers always specify a rectangle in this order:
        North Latitude, South Latitude, East Longitude, and West Longitude
       The region name can be anything (without symbols, especially no commas)
       for example: 38.250,38.125,-122.500,-122.625,Petaluma River
       note that you must use this format, other formats are not recognized.
<p>    4. Note that just before these data are a few lines that represent a subroutine.
       This is also needed and should mimic the other regions with appropriate changes.
       The name of the subroutine is the ChallengeCode.
