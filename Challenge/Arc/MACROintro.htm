<H2>Analyser for Challenge Caches based on regional (maps, quads, counties) challenges</H2>
<p>This macro is designed to process "found cache" data in a GSAK
dataset to see how the dataset meets the requirements of a particular challenge
cache. 
Currently the following types of challenge caches can be handled
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" width="100%"><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Challenge Code</td> <td>Challenge Type</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>DeLorme Challenge based on mapbooks such as Gazetteer</td></tr>
<tr><td>Q</td><td>Quadrangle based on USGS topo map publications or data, incl ADC maps</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>European quads</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>County challenges</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>Irregular polygonal region challenges (Thomas Maps)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p>
<p>Note that type D, C and Q require that every cache in the database
have the State provided. The macro will
update empty county and state fields in the database.
</p>
<p>Note that each challenge is a little bit different even among very similar ones. 
What they have in common is that various regions (rectangular or polygon-shaped) have to be inspected 
to see if at least one of the allowed cachetypes have been found there. 
Some challenges allow virtual caches, some do not, etc.
Some allow only caches found after a particular date. Many have additional rules.  
This macro is designed only for challenges where you must find a cache in various geographic regions.
<p><b>A NOTE OF CAUTION:</b>
DO NOT ASSUME that the macro has the complete rule set implemented for
each challenge,
particularly for unenforcable rules and ones that are just
smoke-screen.
In particular, some challenges may be satisfied by placing a cache; that
feature is not implemented here as each challenge cache owner has different
nuances at different times on this facet; so this processing must be done
manually for each case.
</p>
<h3>C-type Challenges:</h3>
County challenges: the user is needs to find a geocache in each of a
set of counties within some state or states. For Germany it analyzes the analogous
situation: "Kreise" and/or "Kreisstaedte" within states.
C-type challenges are ones for which GSAK has the ability to determine
in which county a particular geocache is located. 
<h3>D-type Challenges:</h3>
DeLorme Gazetteer challenges (these are always rectangular regions where the
boundaries are parallel to lat/lon):
All existing DeLorme Challenges which are known to macro author are included.
<h3>E-type Challenges installed in this version:</h3>
European challenge caches with rectangular regions: These include by
country:
Netherlands - 6 Dutch Challenge caches "Top25 To Move"
<h3>Q-type Challenges (Topo Quads such as USGS topo maps</h3>
Quads are quadratic regions similar based on minutes or degrees of latitude and longitude. No mapbook is involved. 
In the USA there are official quads which have been given names. But quads can also be based on some other regular system.
Included are these:
<ul>
<li>7.5 degree quads </li>
<ul>
<li>CA: SanFrancisco Bay Area
Sacramento Valley area
LA County area (needs testing)
TN (needs testing) </li>
</ul>
<li>15 minute quads </li>
<ul>
<li>CA: Monterey Bay Area </li>
</ul>
<li> 1 minute quad challenges <br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>CA: Davis </li>
</ul>
<li> ADC map books (page borders are parallel to lat/lon </li>
<ul>
<li> Maryland ADC books for: Montgomery and StMary's County </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>P type Challenges: (any other irregular shaped regions, borders not
parallel to lat/lon, etc)</h3>
Thomas Map book for: Portland Oregon; Kings County WA.
<h3>Configuration</h3>
There are a large number of challenge caches that can be processed with
this macro. Those which have been programmed into this macro sit in the
background available for installtion.
Click Configure button to select the ones you want to be able to select
from on the main menu.
<h3>Modes of Operation</h3>
Macro has two modes: (controlled by "Run for NotFound Caches" checkbox)
<p>- to process found caches in a database (leave "Run for NotFound
Caches" un-checked)
</p>
<p>- to process caches which have NOT been found to see which caches
are available
Note that you can check as many challenges as appear installed and they
will all run.
</p>
<h3>Output of macro</h3>
The results of the processing wild display here after processing is
complete. You can also select:
Graphical display of summary in Google Earth. You need to have Google
Earth installed and associated with kml file types.
Selecting file output results in the following
<ul>
<li>CSV - a file that you can open with Excel to do further
processing
of the results
</li>
<li>SQL - an text file containing the SQL database of the resulting
regions
</li>
<li>GPX - GSAK GPX file export of all caches in the results
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
This macro works on the entire selected database; any filters are
cleared.
So be sure the database is up-to-date, that your identity is set
correctly
in GSAK with Tools, Options, "Method for matching...". If you change
that, then be sure to run Database, Repair/Defrag to recalculate the
status.
<p>The cache list: any number of caches can be requested; most
challenge
cache owners want you to submit just ONE. Some early challenge caches
required that you to list the coordinates, but most do not.
Most expect some sort of bookmark list, either one of the ones that you
can set up at geocaching.com or some other list. This macro cannot
automate the setting-up of
the ones a geocaching.com, but it will give you an html file that
should make it easy for you. </p>
<p>You may request a specific number of caches (1, 2, etc) to be
returned in the output or enter the word: All Note that "All" may
result in taking a very long time to complete if you have
a lot of finds; it may also result in a very cluttered display. If you
select "1", then your output includes a lot of extra information
for the one cache that is displayed for each region for which you have
satisfied the challenge. If you select more than one, then only the
GCcodes (linked to the cachepage) will be shown,
