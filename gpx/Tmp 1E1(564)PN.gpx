Virtual Cache
SIZE: Virtual
D1.0/T1.0
DESC: Located in Cape Rock Park overlooking the Mississippi River.
Born on the Mississippi River over 200 years ago, Cape Girardeau has evolved from a tiny French trading post to a frontier settlement governed by a Spanish commandant to a thriving, culturally-rich community of some 40,000 residents on the world&apos;s only inland cape. 

Your goal is to visit the park and answer the following questions:

1.  Who established a trading post on this point in approximately 1733?

2.  Why was a portion of the rock outcropping removed in the late 1800&apos;s?

E-mail the answers to my profile address.....

 <name>Artesian Well</name>
 <sym>Traditional Cache</sym>
 <desc>Artesian Well by JohnTee
Cache ID: GC10ZPR
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: A quick park and grab located off Hwy 34. Located near an artesian
well that has a non-stop supply of cool, running water. This should
take less than 20 minutes. It is potentially handicapped acessible,
if you can hand some rough terrain in the parking area and uneven
ground on the other side of the footbridge.
There are no signs and it&apos;s easy to pass it by, but if you travel
this area much, you just may have visited this artesian well. On
the other hand, you may have driven by it many times, not even
knowing it was there. 
West of Marble Hill on Highway 34, just past Woodland R-4
School, look for a pull-out on the North side of the road. Signs
state &quot;No Parking Within 2&apos; of Pavement&quot;. This is a busy highway,
so watch the traffic. Just slightly east of the pull-out and across
the road is a foot bridge. Begin your adventure there. Search for
the cache and have a drink of some of the coolest, sweetest water
you&apos;ve ever had. Better yet, bring a jug and take some home! The
water is very good!
Why is a well &apos;Artesian&apos;? In recharging aquifers, this happens
because the water table at its recharge zone is at a higher
elevation than the head of the well. &quot;Fossil water&quot; aquifers can
also be artesian if they are under sufficient pressure from the
surrounding rocks. This is similar to how many newly tapped oil
wells are pressurized. Artesian wells were named after the former
province of Artois in France, where many artesian wells were
drilled by Carthusian monks since 1126.[1] The technique was also
known much earlier in Syria and Egypt[2], although whether the
monks of Artois learned of it from outside sources, or discovered
it independently, is unknown. Wikepedia -
Artesian aquifer
The cache is now a small cache, you won&apos;t need to cross any
fences. Watch for poison ivy;  it wasn&apos;t evident when I placed the
cache, but could be present. You may have the area entirely to
yourself, or you may find yourself sharing it with others. If
others are present, there is no cover to hide what you are
doing.
Over 400 sets of coordinates, with an Estimated Position Error
(EPE) of approximately 11&apos;, were averaged for the new
coordinates.

2009-11-08 Sniper1, The water table must be way up due to all the recent rain, because the well had water spewing out of it in every direction.  It looked like a north St Louis fire hydrant on a hot August day.  The cache however was dry as a bone.  As soon as I got it re-hidden, a family of six pulled up and started filling water bottles from the well.  TNLNSL.

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: Located just outside of Old Mckendree Cemetary. This cache is just
1.9 miles from the interstate. Terrian is pretty flat, the cache is
located just a few feet from a small parking area.

Where Travel bugs can visit our Eternaly resting friends. The Old
Mcendree Cemetary Travel Bug hotel is the Ammo box that was given
away at the first and hopefully annual, SEMOG event at Buckners. It
is loaded with a couple geocoins, a travel bug, some bug reppelant,
a flashlight, and a few other things. It is located just outside of
Old Mckendree cemetary, one of the older cemetarys in the area. One
of the last &quot;residents&quot; of the cemetary moved in, in the late 60&apos;s.
You will be looking for a Green ammo box. This seems like a pretty
handy place to leave travel bugs, there have been a couple come and
go already in just the first few weeks. So feel free to leave and
take some travel bugs. Hours the cache is available is from dusk
until dawn. 
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE TRAVEL BUGS UNLESS
YOU PLAN ON HELPING THEM WITH THEIR MISSION, PLEASE DO NOT HOLD ON
TO THEM FOR LONGER THAN NECESSARY, LET SOMEONE ELSE HAVE A CHANCE
TO SHARE IN THE FUN.

My daughter was along too, so it was 3 generations of females caching on this cold, windy day.  I had a great time and I think they did too.  This was the second find of the day.  I had brought two coins with me, so I dropped them here, and retrieved the Todie&apos;s coin.  I found this coin odd, in an amusing way.  I found a different Todie&apos;s coin as the first geocoin I ever found, but it was round in shape and only had a bicycle-looking picture on it.  This one has his photo on one side and a motorcycle and name on the other.  All was good with the cache.  SL and replaced as we found it.  TFTC!!

2009-10-31 TsukiakariUsagi, During this run, designed to just get us out of Carbondale, IL on Halloween for various reasons, we originally planned on grabbing 9 geocaches in 5 different states;  however, one of the caches in Memphis we were unable to grab due to the poor lighting on the riverfront park area, so we had to abandon it altogether, and we replaced the cache &quot;Emerald of Vicksburg&quot; in Mississippi with &quot;Brown not Green&quot; due to the neighborhood not looking like it was the best place to be at dusk.  We looked, but only slightly.  This cache was the fourth of those caches.  This was the first one that we didn&apos;t find today, and hopefully, some day, I&apos;ll actually come back to Cape and find this one, but for now, we still have many more miles to travel before we make it to Memphis and Beale Street, so 30 minutes is all we can dedicate to finding this elusive cache.  Good hide for sure.

 <desc>Forgotten History: Historic Fort &apos;D&apos; by JohnTee
Cache ID: GCZPET
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.5/T1.5
DESC: Located on the first high ground north of the Ohio River, Fort D
was once an important Civil War military post in Cape Girardeau.
Near Sprigg Street, just south of the new river bridge and 3 miles
from I-55. Nearby parking and a mild walk should make this a quick
cache.

One of four forts built in a semi-circle to defend Cape Girardeau
from the Confederates, Fort D is the only fort of the four still in
existence and is now a Cape Girardeau Park. As you approach from
Locust Street, you will come upon what appears to be long ditches,
running parallel to Locust and Fort Streets. You are looking at the
original rifle pits that run in front of the earthen walls on the
south and west sides of the fort. The east side of the fort, with
the Mississippi in the distance, was once a palisade wall of logs.
The stone building located in the center of the fort was built in
1937 and was once a Civil War Museum. There are several
interpretive plaques in the park, a replica of one of the &apos;Quaker
Cannons&apos; and restoration is in progress to the old stone building.
For more information, read this article in the Civil
War News 
Muggles of all ages may be present during nice weather, so
please use your geocaching discretion. For some, this may not be
considered one of Cape Girardeau&apos;s better areas. You may want to
consider doing this during daylight hours and some may wish to
explore this park in the company of others.
You are looking for a micro, containing a log and pencil. Please
try to replace the cache back like you find it . . . like the
cacher before you will hopefully have done! Location will probably
be pretty obvious.
Directions 

From I-55, take exit 95/MO-74 East approximately three miles to
Sprigg St. Turn right, or south, on Sprigg St.
From Illinois, on 146, cross the Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge
and take the first left on Sprigg St.
Go 0.1 miles to Locust St. and turn left, or east. Go to the
end of Locust. 
Five sets of coordinates with an Estimated Position Error (EPE)
of about 17&apos; were averaged for the final set.
Park hours are 6.00am - 11.00pm

SIZE: Small
D1.5/T1.0
DESC: The target is a 3&quot; camo&apos;d container located near Dongola Lake.  It&apos;s just over a mile from the Interstate and is very close to road access.
The site of this cache overlooks where the April 28, 2002 tornado that severely damaged the town of Dongola took a recreational vehicle and tossed it across the lake and impaled it into the ground. Approximately 75 homes were damaged. 

Dongola was the town I grew up in.  The tornado ripped through the woods on our family farm and almost demolished them, twisting them off at the base like toothpicks.  An eighty foot long branch 6 feet in diamater landed 10 feet from our farm house, but miraculously only an awning and the chimney was damaged.

Well today we found ourselves south of here and decided to purposely head this way to get the cache and to visit the main street that dead ends in someone&apos;s driveway. Cache was damp and molded, it needs to be replaced or at least cleaned and waterproofed. 
Shame this lake is off limit now it is a very pretty spot.

DESC: 

This area of Shawnee is great for all types of hunting ,turkey,
deer.
There have been a few record book deer taken from here in the last
4 or 5 years.

 We want you to have to explore a little to check out the area even
if your not a hunter.This trail goes way back but you will need
4-wheel drive .

 Here&apos;s how it works.1st you walk/drive to the area of the
pictures. This is where some slob hunters camp and give hunters a
bad name by leaveing a mess.Guess they don&apos;t know about &quot;leave no
trace&quot; camping.
2nd you head S/E down the main ridge to the coordinates.

 The local cacher GEOJOE has kindly offered to
monitor this cache
Hint: stay on the main ridge.
the cache is in a hollow tree stump covered w/ bark.
you don&apos;t have to go down in valley.

2009-12-22 geckl69, Well, I had a blast driving the Jeep back around in here today!  Got to drop &apos;er into 4x4 and splash around in the mud for a bit here and there.  The last &quot;puddle&quot; I went through was getting pretty deep, but the Jeep pulled through no problem.  I found the nice little campsite, parked the Jeep, and made my way along the ridge the last several hundred feet to an absolute perfect hiding spot.  Well, a few actually, but one that the GPSr kept bringing me back to ... and there was a beer can jammed between some branches in a tree very nearby - about 5 feet up.  A message, perhaps?  I searched several likely spots within a 50+ foot radius, and came up empty.  I hope it&apos;s still there, and maybe I just missed it, but my suspicion is that this one has been muggled.  Maybe next year....  [:(]

2006-03-22 JohnTee, 1230 03/22/06  Maxi the cachehound and I were FTF!  This is First To Find #2!!!  Signed the log.

YOW!  Just figuring out how to get into the general area of Shawnee National Forest where the cache was, was the most challenging part of this cache.  At that, I don&apos;t think I chose the easiest way.  Came in from McClure on Grapevine Road, to &apos;4&apos;.  Microsoft Streets showed a  &apos;local road&apos; going from &apos;4&apos; in the general direction of the cache.  Turned onto &quot;Eudy Road&quot; and chatted for a bit with the farmer who lived at the end of the road.  He told me the road used to go through 30 years ago, but hasn&apos;t gone through in the 20 years he&apos;s lived there.  Nice fella, though.

Got back on &apos;4&apos; and veered off it toward the NE on one of the Shawnee National Forest Roads, circled around the cache several miles to the North and then took another Shawnee National Forest Road South, more or less through the middle of the forest to Oppossum Trot Trail.  Found a little service road off Oppossum Trot Trail, immediately North of the cache.  Took that a couple hundred yards to the SW and decided that was as far as it was going today;  it turned off to the NW and DOWN a muddy hill.  I knew I could get down in 4W drive, but was not sure about geting back up.  Parked and walked in the rest of the way.

Bushwacked a deer trail in a generally Southerly direction, DOWN a steep hill to the bottom of this ravine (huge ravine/valley), worked south down the valley, then climbed another big hill to get to the cache.  Was getting a good reading in one spot and thought it had to be there, but moved a little further to the South and found it.

Beutiful area.  Maxi loved running the trails.  And to think I did this one instead of &quot;Ripple Hollow Cache  by Myotis (GCFAA6&quot;) because I thought it would be easier to get at.  At least Ripple Hollow had directions to several parking areas.  Even drove right by one of the places I marked on my map.  At least I had a good navigator in the form of Streets!

It was lunchtime as I drove back to Cape through Tamms.  Decided to look for a place to get a sandwich.  Found the only place in town, &quot;Tamms BBQ&quot;.  Good food and nice people.  Stop in and tell them hello.

DESC: This Cache is located near Safety city in the Jackson City park
I gave this one a 2/2 rating because the walk could be around a half mile if you choose.

  I am posting waypoints to 2 different parking areas.  The POOL parking lot is about a half a mile from the cache, the SAFETY parking lot is about 200 ft.  I recommend the pool parking lot if it is a nice day out, and you enjoy walking.
Since the cache is right next to safety city BEWARE OF MUGGLES.

The items I put in to start out are:
1 bottle germ x
1 tube of chapstick
1 container of carmex
1 pack of halls cough drops
1 pack of kleexex
1 pack of moist wipes
1 deck of sponge bob playing cards
1 beach bum travel bug

Permission granted by Jackson parks department.


The Jackson City Park is centrally located within the city, being roughly bounded by North High Street to the east, Main Street to the south, Farmington Road to the west, and Highway D to the north. The park has a wide variety of facilities, including multiple baseball, softball, and T-Ball fields, soccer fields, a 1/2 mile running path around Rotary Lake, tennis courts, basketball courts, a band shelter, picnic tables under shelters, a swimming pool, and various playground equipment for the kids.

  Safety City is an educational program especially for kindergartners through fourth graders, that helps instruct children on traffic safety for while riding bicycles, in-line skates, and skateboards, and while riding in automobiles.  Other topics covered are drug awareness, fire safety, and &quot;stranger danger.&quot;

Greetings,

I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled, or has not been found for a period of time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can&apos;t do so forever. When you get a chance, please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it (using the [i]archive listing [/i] link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b] log a note to the cache [/b] (not email) so I don&apos;t archive the listing for non-communication. I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. [b]If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.[/b]

If the [B][RED]Needs Maintenance[/B][/RED] attribute is showing you will need to also write a [B][GREEN]Owners Maintenance[/B][/GREEN] note to remove it. http://support.groundspeak.com/Support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=333&amp;nav=0,5,15

Cache ID: GCYEN7
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.5/T1.5
DESC: GO TAKE A WALK! and do a series of geocaches along Cape Girardeau&apos;s
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail. This is Part Two of a series of
caches along the trail, numbered as placed, and NOT in any sequence
along the trail. 
The walk is all paved asphalt, with few, gentle inclines and
occasional bridges. Trail open from 6:00 a.m. ? 11:00 p.m.
The recreation trail is a very popular place when the weather is
the least bit nice. You can expect walkers, joggers and bicyclists.
Be aware of muggles as you cache along the trail. 
This is a micro, log and pencil included. You&apos;ll have to do a
little bit of looking, but it&apos;s not bad. It is not handicapped
accessible.
The recreation trail can be accessed from multiple points in
Cape Girardeau - time to explore! Eventually, you will be able to
geocache multiple caches, from one end to the trail to the other.

Be sure you don&apos;t miss other caches in the area. There is a
parking lot immediately west of this geocache.
Accuracy
Five sets of coordinates, with an 8&apos; Estimated Position Error
(EPE)were averaged to give the final set listed here.
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail
 For joggers, walkers, bicyclists, rollerbladers and skateboarders,
the 4.4-mile asphalt Cape La Croix Recreation Trail connects the
Osage Community Centre on the north and Shawnee Park Sports Complex
on the south, while avoiding the need to cross city streets. It
provides users with a safe recreational experience as it skirts the
banks of the Cape La Croix Creek.
For more information on the trail, visit the 
Cape Girardeau Parks and Recreation web page.
Permission to place geocaches in Cape Girardeau Parks was
obtained from Dan Muser, Parks and Recreation Department.

Fountain Trail begins at a small roadside park along Cape Rock Drive, just about two-tenths of a mile west of Cape Rock Park, which overlooks the Mississippi River. The little park is situated across the road from the Cape Girardeau Water Treatment Plant.

The area was built in 1931 by employees of the former Missouri Utilities before the city of Cape Girardeau took over the water plant. The park is maintained by the city&apos;s Parks &amp; Recreation Department.

The rock fountain with its goldfish pond is a picturesque setting for a picnic or a short walk in the woods. 

The park department granted permission to place the cache.

The weather today was gorgeous – short-sleeves from the start – if there was a problem it was time (not enough). Several things I like about caching in the Cape. First, the coordinates are nearly always dead on. Second, almost every cache was placed with approval. That makes for a lot less stress when searching. Thanks Cape cachers – you provide a model we all should follow.

Find #12 of 23 (tying for my second best caching day). Beautiful mini park and great little trail. The cache had a little water in it. The triple bagging kept the log dry.

2009-12-26 6Lindseys, I am up visiting relatives in southeast Mo for the holiday and talked my mom into going caching with me today.  My daughter was along too, so it was 3 generations of females caching on this cold, windy day.  I had a great time and I think they did too.  There was water surrounding the cache container, but all was well with the container and it&apos;s contents.  I dropped a couple of TBs that I had gotten in Tennessee into the cache and retrieved the only TB that was in it.  SL and replaced as we found it.  We really enjoyed this hide.  TFTC!!

DESC: A forgotten piece of history located along Highway 146, between
Ware and Anna-Jonesboro, IL. A quick park and grab, with a little
bit of history. Handicapped accessible if you can handle a
graveled/asphalt parking lot.
This cache is located at a historical marker along Highway 146.
I&apos;ve driven by this many a time without ever stopping to see what
it was about. &apos;Forgotten History&apos; because this looks like a
historical marker that that has been forgotten about. The area is
maintained as far as mowing goes and the pull-out area has been
freshly re-finished. The sign, on the other hand, is very hard to
read due to fading. However, a picture with flash really brought
out the wording: 

For those that are paperless, here is the information recorded
on the historical marker . . .


ANNA-JONESBORO

Union County was created on January 2, 1818 by an act of the
Territory of Illinois. Two months later, on March 2, 1818, the
County commissioners Court established Jonesboro on land donated by
John and Juliet Grammar to serve as County Seat. In the 1850&apos;s it
was decided that the Illinois Central would run through this area.
To ensure that the railroad would go through the town, Jonesboro
was to have a survey made for the railroad. It said that when the
town failed to meet this request, Winstead Davie of Jonesboro
submitted a survey routing the railroad through his property East
of Jonesboro. A town was established by the railroad and Davie
named it Anna in honor of his wife on March 3, 1854. 
Jonesboro was the site of the third of the seven Lincoln-Douglas
Debates on September 15, 1858. Lincoln received a quiet welcome on
his arrival and spent the night before the debate as the guest of
D.L. Phillips of Anna. The otherwise uneventful evening was
enlivened by the appearance of Donati&apos;s Comet. Douglas&apos;s arrival
was better received than Lincoln&apos;s. However, the debate was
attended by less than 1500 unenthusiastic people -- the smallest
crowd of the series -- and neither man gained ground.
Anna served as one of the nine rendezvous points for troops
during the Civil War and eight regiments were assembled here. In
1869 the Legislature determined to locate the Southern Illinois
Hospital for the Insane at Anna. It is now that Anna State
Hospital.

You are looking for a camouflaged micro that contains only a log
sheet. Please bring your own pen or pencil.

Cache ID: GC158CW
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D1.5/T1.0
DESC: This is a small Lock-n-Lock cache that will hold a few small items.  It contains a geocoin and a travel bug.
This cache is hidden in the Mississippi Bridge Overlook Park, a new part of the Cape Girardeau Parks and Recreation Department.  This is the location of the first river bridge across the Mississippi at Cape Girardeau.  The approach to the old bridge has been preserved and converted to this overlook park.  Permission was granted by Dan Muser for placement of this cache with a caution to be aware of Muggles while searching for it.  

The original Mississippi River Bridge that was erected at this spot began its inception in December of 1926 as the American Bridge Co. won the bid for the superstructure and U.G.I. Contracting Co. won the bid for the substructure at a total of $1.2 million.   

On February 5, 1927 construction began on the first pier.  Bridge traffic opened at 11:43 a..m. on September 3, 1928 with 15,000 people in attendance.  The bridge had to close the very next day for last minute paving and painting.  On September 12, 1928, the bridge permanently opened for business at a cost of $1.00/car and 10 cents/passenger.  The last toll was collected at 5:30 a.m. on June 29, 1957.  The last car rolled across the old bridge December 13, 2003 when the new Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge officially opened.

Demolition of the old bridge began on June 21, 2004.  On August 3, 2004 the first of four Illinois spans were blasted with the next span being blown up on August 26th.  On September 9, 2004 the third demolition phase, which was intended to bring down only the span over the main channel, caused the other two remaining spans to collapse as well.

DESC: A quick stop off IL Route 3, near Cape Girardeau. Paved parking lot
and flat terrain should make this easily handicapped accessible.
You&apos;re traveling on &quot;The Great River Road&quot; . . . Below is the
content of the nearby historical marker . . . 
In 1673 Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette
explored the Illinois country for France. By the 1763 treaty ending
the French and Indian War, this area passed to England. During the
American Revolution, George Rogers Clark&apos;s men captured it for the
Commonwealth of Virgnia. Illinois was later governed as part of the
Northwest Territory, Indiana Territory, and the Illinois Territory.
In 1818, Illinois entered the Union as the twenty-first
state.
Permanent American settlers began arriving at the state&apos;s
southwestern tip in 1805. Earthquakes rocked the Mississippi Valley
in 1811, bringing refugees here in search of new homesites. After
the War of 1812, another wave of settlers came, some bringing
slaves. The newcomers raised cotton, flax, and tobacco. Later, they
raised corn and wheat.
Northeast form here, at Jonesboro, Abraham Lincoln debated
Stephen A. Douglas during the 1858 Senatorial campaign. During the
Civil War, Cairo served as a major staging base where men and
supplies were assembled before departing for the war zones. Mound
City on the Ohio River was the principal depot for the Western
River Fleet. Nearby is Thebes, once a bustling river port, the town
declined when railroads replaced the steamboats, but the beautiful
1848 courthouse still stands. Nowadays, tourists and hunters are
drawn to &apos;Egypt&apos;-- Illinois&apos; sixteen southernmost counties -- by
the beauty of the Shawnee Forest and wildlife at Horseshoe
Lake.
There are also some nearby interpretative plaques with
information on Madison, St. Clair, Monroe, Randolph, Jackson, Union
and Alexander Counties.
The cache container is something between a micro and a nano in
size. You&apos;ll understand once you find it. It contains a log only,
so BYOP (Bring Your Own Pen). The cache can replaced in a
horizontal or vertical manner . . . it will be well hidden
horizontal and may be visible to passersby if vertical - Please
replace it horizontally.
Hint: 1) Lunch break
2) What holds it all together?

Quote from Warbird Alley
History: Initially dubbed &apos;Heinemann&apos;s Hot Rod&apos; after chief
design engineer Ed Heinemann, the A-4 Skyhawk is one of the best
jet aircraft to have served with the US Navy and Marine Corps.
Chosen to replace the A-1 Skyraider, the A-4&apos;s small design and
light weight gave it the speed and power to exceed the Navy&apos;s
specifications and fight on until today in air forces around the
world.
The delta wing aircraft houses its avionics in the nose, along
with a pair of cannons for dealing with aerial adversaries. The
wings hold the fuel tanks, and the Pratt &amp;amp;  Whitney turbojet
fits snugly in the fuselage. Ordered during the Korean War, the A-4
was delivered to the US Navy VA-72 attack squadron on October 26,
1956. Other squadrons were soon re-equipped as soon as aircraft
became available. The Marines began receiving their A-4s in January
1957. By the time of the Vietnam War, all carrier wings had at
least two Skyhawk squadrons. The A-4s were soon performing most of
the Navy&apos;s and Marine Corps&apos; light air attack missions over the
jungles and mountains of Vietnam. It was not long before McDonnell
Douglas also produced a two-seat trainer, the TA-4. The A-4 has
been sold to countries around the world and has seen combat with
the air forces of Kuwait, Israel and Argentina. Production finally
ceased in 1979.
Until recently, both the US Navy and Marine Corps used A-4s for
training purposes. Skyhawks are still found serving as frontline
units in several smaller countries. As of 2001, there were nine
single-seat Skyhawks and three TA-4s on the US civil register,
although not all were airworthy. [History by David

2009-12-26 6Lindseys, I am up visiting relatives in southeast Mo for the holiday and talked my mom into going caching with me today.  My daughter was along too, so it was 3 generations of females caching on this cold, windy day.  I had a great time and I think they did too.  This one took us a couple of minutes to locate.  It would have been really difficult if we hadn&apos;t paid attention to the cache name!All was good with the cache.  SL and replaced.  TFTC!!

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: This cache is located on the norhbound service running parallel to the southbound side of Interstate 55.  Take the Perryville exit to get to this road.  This cache was placed for the person on a lunch hour with just a little time, or the person driving on the highway, not having time to cache, but needing that caching fix.  This should be EASY!
The cache container is a small, film canister-type container.  It is black.  

The terrain is not rough, but is not wheelchair accessible due to high grasses and the cedar trees themselves. 

Parking on the shoulder is available, and there isn&apos;t much traffic on this end of the road.
Hint: Ummmmmmmm. Cedar tree.

These caches are a series but do not need to be completed in order for any reason so do in any order.  They are placed along the Shoreline Trail at Perry County Community Lake.  This is a great trail for a walk very well maintained.  And we are asked by the Conservation Department to respect the land that they work so hard to maintain.  These should be a nice easy find for most all cachers.  Good luck to all and hope you enjoy the time you spend on these.

2009-12-26 6Lindseys, I am up visiting relatives in southeast Mo for the holiday and talked my mom into going caching with me today.  My daughter was along too, so it was 3 generations of females caching on this cold, windy day.  I had a great time and I think they did too.  This one was the cache we got the coldest while locating and walking.  The closest parking to this one was a bit of a distance for the weather today.  There were actually a couple of muggles that passed too, so we had to wait them out.  We saw the cache before we were really very close.  All was well with it.  I dropped a couple of TBs that I had gotten in Tennessee into the cache and SL.  We replaced it better than we found it so that it would not be so obvious.  Thank you for placing this ammo can for us to find.  It is my daughter&apos;s favorite container.  TFTC!!

2009-09-18 mbell72901, Property owner ran us off his property. Said he has NOT given any permission for anyone to hide anything on his property.  Showed us the No Tresspassing sign on the side of the closest building. Said he owns all the buildings there and the rock wall is on his property and no one is allowed to mess with or go on the rock wall.  He said he has never been asked by anyone about hiding anyghing there. So cache should be discontinued until this is solved. Very embarassing for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Quetil Hiking Trail is a rather short but has some interesting huge rocks and cliffs to explorer.

A Little History-
In 1860 this settlement was widely known as Quetil Gap after Charles Julius Quetil. In 1878 the Cairo and St.Louis Narrow Gauge Railroad adopted the name of Alto Pass the citizens of Alto Pass acted to have the town incorporated in 1882. The Railway Company in conjunction with the citizens erected a passenger and freight depot where the pavilion is now located. This old railway was abandoned in 1981.

THERE IS NO CONTAINER AT THE POSTED COORDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YOU MUST DOWNLOAD AND PLAY THE WHERIGO CARTRIDGE TO GET TO THE
FINAL CONTAINER.
This

cartridge will take you on a tour of the fitness trail at the
Jackson Purchase Medical Center. Truth be told I just wanted to
place a Wherigo cache and this is the first place that came to
mind, not to mention it is right off of I-24 making it a great
place to pull off and stretch. The trail is paved and loops around
a pond providing some nice scenery. You should see geese and fish
swimming in the pond. This one should not take long to complete and
the final container is also on the hospital grounds. Just park
close to the start and when you are done on the trail jump into
your car and drive to the final which is very close to parking as
well. Once again the final is on the hospital grounds. Driving to
it will save you walking back to the car! 
Don&apos;t forget to download the

This is a good cart for anyone looking to see how easy it is to find a Wherigo cache.  Found all of the stages readily and had no problems with the zones.  Off to the final and walked right up to it.  However, when Jersey Girl retrieved the cache we were unable to sign the log because it was really wet.  We signed a Florida Geocaching card and added it to the log.  Thanks for taking the time to put this cart together...

On the way to GW7 w/MutherAndSun. Had to do some caches on the way down. Since Mummie had just received her new Oregon, she was itching to do a &quot;Wherigo&quot; cache, so here we go. At a few of the stops, GZ seemed to be moving around. So we had to chase it to move to the next page. Good job on putting it together though. Might want to keep an eye on the final as there is logs of construction REAL close! Thanks for the cache and giving us a chance to do one of these!

Gooosie and I were heading to the GW7 and snatching up caches along the way!  

I had been wanting to do a wherigo for a long time, but was using a Delorme PN20.  A dear friend of mine allowed me to use the new PN40 for a few months and boy that was an improvement!  But when REI and Garmin dropped the price of the Oregon 400, I just had to give it a shot.  This is my first Garmin and I am so excited and pleased with the touchscreen and all the bells and whistles.  And now, a wherigo!  I&apos;m a fan of virtuals and earthcaches and now wherigo also!  This was a great cartridge to get my feet wet with, a nice simple layout.  I did have to walk in circles a couple of times to get to 0ft, which felt kind of silly and fun.  I was able to zero out at the final as well.  Thanks for putting this together and giving us a tour of the grounds!  Whoo Hoo, Wherigo here I come!

2009-05-21 FRIED OKRA, I&apos;ve been looking forward to doing this Wherigo since I started planning my trip to GW7.  The weather was spot on perfect and the cartridge worked like a charm.  I found the final and signed the log.  The log was a bit damp.  I couldn&apos;t get the final zone to zero out.  The best I could get was 3 feet.

Thanks for the great Wherigo.  I met several very nice people on the trail as well as some not so nice geese.

2008-12-19 CyclonicKWF, I had a week off after finals and I figured I would get some caching done this week. I had contacted Regnad about going and he said he would be interested. We thought we would head out earlier in the week. However the Ice Storm that arrived hampered our plans. Finally I saw the forecast calling for the weather warming up today with the small chance of rain ending before lunch. Regnad said he was game, so we made our arrangements. We both fully expected to encounter rain on the early part of the trip. The rain moved out earlier, so we were both pleasantly surprised to have a beautiful day in the 60&apos;s. Though it was a little WINDY.

This was the last cache as we worked to clean up Mayfield -- our first try at a Wherigo cache.  As we headed to Mayfield I mentioned we could go do this cache since I have an Oregon and he liked the idea.  We did not know what to expect, thought I had played around with the cartridge on the player on my PC.  We both had done the other caches here, so we knew the path we would be taken.  As has been mentioned before some of the areas on the first part are a little tight.  With the new landscaping it made for a messy first part.  Kind of funny about the camo caches since we were joking about how they would make a good container to hide a cache in.  We were hoping the final was bigger, but it still kinds as a find. 

Solarwib and Kodiak can claim first to find on the first Kentucky Wherigo cache, but we can claim first to find with a GPS designed to find Wherigo caches!  [:D]  Who knows maybe I will see about coming up with one or two myself.

Signed the log and then headed on. Thanks for the cache!

2008-12-19 regnad, What a beautiful day today turned out to be. Cyclonic and I had been talking about going on a geocaching run for several days now, but the weather was less than cooperative. So when we realized that we were going to get an unseasonable break today, we decided to captialize on it. I mean, who could pass up a 60 degree day in the middle of December!!

Since Cyclonic recently purchased a Garmin Oregon GPSr, we just had to stop and do this cache.  We were a little confused about how to get it started since we arrived at what we thought was the starting point, but nothing happened on the Oregon.  However, we quickly realized that we had to be on the EXACT spot of the original coordinates, which meant we had to walk around in circles waiting for it to count down to exactly zero.  This proved a little frustrating throughout the first half of the walking tour, but got better one we got out from under the tree cover.

It should be noted that one of the items mentioned on the cartridge is currently not there due to the landscaping going on in the area.  Additionally, since we had to &quot;zero out&quot; the GPSr at each stop, this meant that we had to get off the trail a few times.  It appears that some of the landscaping has been placed since the cartridge was created as we had to step over several bushes and flowers to get past a couple of spots.

FYI:  The final container was soaking wet too.  We didn&apos;t have a replacement log on us, so we tried our best to sign the wet log.

DESC: Mainly on pavement, you will have to leave the sidewalk to find the actual cache.
This cache is located on the grounds of the Mayfield/Graves County Art Guild (and history museum) downtown Mayfield.
The coords will bring you to the front porch where the next set of coords are posted, somewhere in plain view (not in a container and nothing needs to be moved or disturbed). The second stage is a nano with the final coords to the actual cache.  The cache is a paintball container, approximately 10&quot; length and 2.5&quot; diameter. There is a special FTF prize which can be redeemed at the Gallery of the Art Guild. FTF must bring the card in the cache to redeem, during regular open hours of Tuesday-Friday 10:00am to 4:30 pm and Saturday 10:00 am to 1:00 pm. I encourage you to spend some time in this historic building and view whatever exhibits are on display, as we do not have much culture in this small town. Oh yeah, there is a bank in close proximity to the cache, so beware of muggles. Good luck....
Sad note...Claude has passed on due to a series of health issues, so I guess the title should read &quot;Claude Monet lived here&quot;

2009-10-16 maleki, Excellent cache in an even better location.  Micros in the woods are cool as long as they are at a place like this.  The day after we were here I noticed that someone had uploaded a pic to Google Earth of this cache area.  Glad there are some about as I had forgotten the cam in the car.   Really nice area and terrain that we do not see in northern Illiniois.  TFTC!  Great time!!!

2009-01-07 photohiker13, After a DNF at Rim Rock, I wanted another find, so I pulled into Pounds Hollow.  Arghh!  The gate were locked, but then I seen a sign that said foot traffic welcome.  Wait a minute!  I have feet and I am welcome, so I happly took down the road to the cache.  When I got there I thought it was going to be another DNF.  &quot;Who put&apos;s a micro in the woods?&quot;, I thought, especially with all the rocky cracks to put one in  I read the cache description again and a light bulb went off in my head.  So I followed my hunch and logged a smiley. Stuffed a geocoin in to go along with the lonely log. TFTC.

DESC: You will find this on the outskirts of a local cemetery.  It is off a dirt road but should require no bush whacking as the area is well maintained.  I would be willing to bet a wheelchair could be used but preferably with some off road tires!
You are looking for a decon container. The first to find can choose between one of two magnets.  There is one jeep TB also in the cache.  The cache will only hold a 2-4 smaller items.  

Be sure to take a look around the area.  When my mother-in-law moved in to the area, this cemetery was 1/4 the size it is now and the population of Morley was less than 700.  The city of Oran not to far away is known for their for car shows.  And if you drive through Benton, MO sometimes they have really unique little sayings on the sign at the main intersection.  Also there is a great memorial to our military right off the road.

DESC: This is a Nano on a bridge on Paducah&apos;s Greenway Trail
I know this is not my typical cache hide but I was Under the
Influence of PEER PRESSURE! : ) I had several caches out for the
Paducah Parks introduction to geocaching fall fun day and several
people were asking if one of the caches was going to be listed .
Several folks agreed that this was a good hunt and said it would be
a good one to leave out so here it is. Closest parking is about.12
mile at Stuart Nelson park by the start of the Disc Golf course, so
watch for flying discs. While you are here take a walk or bring
your bikes to check out the trail. If you have never tried Disc
Golf bring some Frisbees and fling a few or strike up a
conversation with some the Disc Golfers, most will not mind letting
you play a few holes with them. 

A 1.75 mile section of the Greenway Trail connecting Noble Park,
Stuart Nelson Park and Coleman Road is now open from dawn to dusk.
This trail is available for all non-motorized traffic during
standard park hours. The trail is made up of dense packed gravel
and can be traveled in a wheel chair. 

When completed the over 5 mile long Greenway Trail will link the
Perkins Creek Nature Preserve, Stuart Nelson Park, Noble Park &amp;amp; 
Schultz Park The trail will be a combination of paved and dense
packed gravel. Lights, seating, emergency call boxes, and
interpretive signs will be a part of the completed trail.

2009-11-28 GEO.JOE, Thanks 6Lindseys for checking on this cache. Now that you know how close I live to it and that I had almost 200 of the nanos at the camping trip, I bet you think poorly of me for not getting by there yet : ). I just replaced another Nano today and was going to paint up the one I pulled and head out to check on this one in the next day or two,  but I can do something else. You guys are the greatest!.
Glad you enjoyed it.

2009-11-28 6Lindseys, I saw this one on the list of caches on the way past Paducah a few days before, but we were running behind on the time schedule.  We were headed home to Bowling Green from the Thanksgiving holiday at my parents&apos; home in Missouri today and had a more leisurely schedule.  The sun was getting low but  I decided we probably had enough daylight to go check on this cache for Geo.Joe and FairyFlirt.  We realized we were hungry just as we were hitting town, so we grabbed food to-go and headed for this cache.  There were quite a few people out walking and a couple of joggers that passed us and gave us funny looks as we were walking along the path eating our french fries...  This really is such a nice greenways path!  We have seen several nice paths like this in other towns but unfortunately Bowling Green does not have anything really like them.  We arrived at the bridge and after just a few minutes looking, I had the cache in hand.  That really was a nice hide!  This was our last find of the day and was definitely my favorite.  I enjoyed the company, the place, the hide, the setting sun, and being able reassure some great friends that their little cache was still there.

trouble locking in the coordinates. The coordinates are an average,

2009-10-31 TsukiakariUsagi, During this run, designed to just get us out of Carbondale, IL on Halloween for various reasons, we originally planned on grabbing 9 geocaches in 5 different states;  however, one of the caches in Memphis we were unable to grab due to the poor lighting on the riverfront park area, so we had to abandon it altogether, and we replaced the cache &quot;Emerald of Vicksburg&quot; in Mississippi with &quot;Brown not Green&quot; due to the neighborhood not looking like it was the best place to be at dusk.  We looked, but only slightly.  This cache was the first of those caches.  Fun find, coordinates right on, and the cache is still intact.

SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T2.5
DESC: You will just have to visit the cache to appreciate the
name.
This cache is placed at the south end of a really pretty ¼ mile
long narrows in Rice Hollow - where the bluff walls come to within
30 feet of each other at the narrowest point. At the cache location
there are large boulders to explore up and around and even through
a tunnel between them. There is easy access to the top of a bluff
across the creek from the cache if you want to check out that view
of the valley. Depending on how much you want to hike there are
several options of parking locations and trails to explore. To help
plan your visit check out the
SNF Trail Map. 
I will give you a couple options to access the cache that I have
used. Remember to wear proper footwear, you will be on trails
shared with horses and there are several creek crossing in the
narrows which are navigable on rocks in tennis shoes a lot of the
time but after rains or wet times the water will be flowing. 

The closest trail access is at N37 36.929 W88 20.757 This is a very
faint horse trail with enough room for 3 cars to park along the
side of the road. This trail will lead you down the hill to a slick
rock creek just above a waterfall N37 36.825 W88 20.856 then work
your way back north along the bluff top to a spot you can scramble
down into the midway point of the narrows N37 36.871 W88 20.900.
This will be a minimum .75 mile walk with steep elevation changes.


For a more adventurous hike, park where you would for Buzzard Point
cache (GCK20F) N37.36.053 W088.21.703. Go east along River to River
Trail to N37.35.994 W88.21.281 turn north along lower trail between
boulders to N37.36.052 W88.21.257 then left along the towering
cliffs of Basin Bluff (this is trail #137 on the above map but you
may still see #110 on trees from the old numbering system). Follow

2009-07-21 photohiker13, Thanks for the update and the hints on the cache.  I hope to locate it soon.  Love the &quot;wild caches&quot;!

2009-06-28 GEO.JOE, We visited the area to check out what TeePee was on a map that we had seen and we found where someone leaned limbs together to make a wooden teepee shape that you can crawl inside of. It is not enough of an interest to make the 2 mile hike ;  ) We saw 2 ring neck snakes, a salamander and tons of toads. 
The cache was still there and in good shape. However, the leaf litter had packed on and around the cache so that I just about didn&apos;t find it. I covered it with a piece of cedar log so that it will not get incorporated with the leaf litter again. I also added some more specific hints and a picture from the cache site to make it easier to find the cache.

2009-02-07 regnad, Darua, Ethan and I decided to spend this beautiful 65 degree day out geocaching instead of cleaning up all the debris in our yard from the recent Ice Storm 09.

You weren&apos;t kidding when you said that the ground would be little soggy in wet weather.  We all got extremely muddy today while trying to nab this cache.  We also had to take an indirect path back to the cache due to the electrical lines laying on the ground not too far away.  I&apos;m pretty sure that they are not live, but hopefully the crews will be able to get them back up on the utility poles soon.  I&apos;m sure the locals would sure appreciate it.

2009-02-01 BSAK07, Stopped here on a whirlwind 8 state caching weekend roundtrip from Louisville. Looked like a cool store - wish it had been open when we were there. It was almost dark and we almost ran into the cable crossing the driveway - so be careful! Took Kentucky coin and unfortunately was not able to place it into a Kentucky cache so we&apos;ll place it in our home state of RI with the mission to get back to KY. Left a couple of TBs we brought from RI.

 <name>Fishgap Hill, Chickasaw Bluffs Earthcache</name>
 <sym>Earthcache</sym>
 <desc>Fishgap Hill, Chickasaw Bluffs Earthcache by Influence Waterfowl Calls
Cache ID: GC1HWA9
Earthcache
SIZE: Not chosen
D1.0/T1.5
DESC: The Chickasaw Bluffs are high ground rising 50 to 200 feet above
the flood plain of the Mississippi River between Memphis, Tennessee
and Hickman, Kentucky.
Composed of eroded loess over glacial gravel they are slide prone.
This elevation is named for the Chickasaw Indians who by their
possession of the elevation impeded French river traffic in the
18th Century. At the border between Kentucky and Tennessee, the
left bank of the Mississippi River strikes the western edge of
these uplands, exposing four banks of up to thirty feet in height.
The Chickasaw Bluffs secured Memphis from river floods, while a
rare shelf of sandstone below provided a secure boat landing,
making this the &quot;only site for a commercial mart&quot; between the Ohio
River and Vicksburg, Mississippi.
The above coordinates will take you to a part of the Chickasaw
Bluffs known as Fishgap Hill which is close to Reelfoot Lake.
Because of the bluffs close proximity to the Quake Lake (Reelfoot
Lake) it is believed to be a result of earthquakes of the past.
Some say that there is an earthquake fault below the bluffs but it
is well known that the bluffs were here before the earthquakes of
1811-1812 that formed the lake.






The above picture is of a land slide at Chickasaw Bluff after
the Quake of 1812.
From Fishgap Hill you will be able to see the Upper Blue Basin
of Reelfoot Lake. Reelfoot Lake is the winter home of many Bald
Eagles and vast numbers of waterfowl. While looking at the lake you
will notice larger blocky things in the lake, these are some of the
many duck blinds on the lake used to hunt the waterfowl. One of the
blinds is mine but it is harder to see because it is along the far
bank of the lake. Of course this lake is FULL of fish as well and
until 2005 it was the only lake in the world where it was legal to
commercially fish for crappie. You can see for a great distance
past the lake as well because of the area being ancient flood plain
of the Mississippi River which has changed course in this area many
times over years as it slowly eroded its banks.
The bluff&apos;s elevation is partially due to loess deposits. Loess
is defined as wind-blown particles of predominantly silt size.
During and following a sequence of ice age glacial cycles, massive
quantities of water flowed through the area now occupied by the
Mississippi River It is believed that each winter when the vast
flood plains dried, strong winds blowing across the mud flats
picked up large quantities of silt which then were deposited across
the landscape. This process took place over thousands of years.
Here near the source, the silt deposits are deeper but the depth of
loess decreases as one goes eastward from the floodplain source.
Some loess bluffs erode away slowly as they are rained on and the
water runs down the slope. The growth of vegetation such as trees
and ivy can help slow the erosion of the bluff. Loess can also
collapse when water-saturated or if they are under cut by a river.
When loess collapses you will be able to see the many layers of
sediment and gravel in the vertical slope of the bluff.



Three forces came together to create this bluff and others like
it: (1) the grinding action of glaciers pulverized some of the soil
and rock into flour-like silt particles, (2) melt water from the
glacial ice created movement of the silt onto the flood plains and
(3) wind carried the loess to the bluff area and beyond.

 To log this earth cache as a find you will need to take a picture
of you with your GPSr and the view from the bluff behind you and
answers the following questions show the educational value of this
earthcache. 1. As to the current appearance of this area of the
Chickasaw Bluffs? Does it appear to have been formed by erosion
(steep but not vertical) or collapse (vertical) of the bluff. 2. As
to the formation of this area of the Chickasaw Bluffs by the
Mississippi River or its Flood waters? Would you say that the
Mississippi River or its flood waters affected this area recently
(in the past 100 years) or long ago (well over 100 years
ago)?

2009-09-15 Satchamo 44, I must say Spankyjoe, I loved your camouflage!  But I will warn future cachers, do not try to retrieve this after sundown like I did at 7:30 p.m. tonight, after a rain, while its still before the killing frost.  Be prepared to donate a pint of blood to the skeeters, that is if they don&apos;t carry you off into the woods to eat at their leisure.  I&apos;m not kidding about the pint of blood,  I think I have 100 bites and I had on a short sleeve t-shirt, knee pants, ankle socks, and I have very few spots of skin left without a skeeter bite.  So beware if you do this at night before we have a killing frost.  Wouldn&apos;t have found the area without the signs pointing the way to Old Bethel.  I kept wanting to turn off sooner.   Retrieved easily in spite of the fact that I&apos;m highly allergic to poison ivy.  Dropped Speedy Dash TB, his owner released him in Arkansas, his mission to travel to Missouri.  Well, I picked him up out of the Bill Emerson Visitor&apos;s Center Cache, so he&apos;s already been into Missouri, Wappapello and Poplar Bluff.  I did take him to St. Charles today, but I ran out of time to go caching there, so he ended up in Jackson after first trying to land in the I-55 Travel Bug Inn.  Who knew that muggles (in the form of cross country runners and trail bike riders) used this park?  Plus 2 people just sitting at a picnic table talking.  Since my invisibility mode wasn&apos;t working, I-55 Travel Bug Inn, lost out on a traveler.

 <desc>No More Serenity by USN-Ret (and daughters)
Cache ID: GC1J5K6
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.0/T1.5
DESC: Near the Panthers Den Wilderness Area of the Shawnee National Forest just off a well-marked trail.
Parking and the trailhead is at N 37º 34.796 W 089º 05.290. 

This cache is dedicated to my adopted daughter, who is often my caching partner. At four she has more personality in a minute than most people can muster up in an hour. Life with her is funny and exciting, but seldom serene.

The cache is located not far from the trailhead, but I would encourage you to follow the trail further and explore the area. It will tee with the River-to-River Trail, and if you follow the trail to the left at the intersection, you can loop around and eventually end up back where you started, about a 2 ½ mile loop.

Following the trail toward N37º 35.402, W089º 04.872 will bring you into some of the rock formations like you see in nearby Giant City. My Boy Scouts really like coming down here to camp, and I use this area to teach the Troop the principles of Leave No Trace camping. Not everyone who camps down here practices Leave No Trace, so it?s also a great place to CITO. I would have hid the cache down here, but this is designated as a wilderness area, so no caches allowed.

The trail drops down in to the bottom of the watershed, and if you follow the streams you?ll come to the tip of one of the ?fingers? of Devil?s Kitchen Lake. You can follow the River-to-River Trail blazes (a white diamond nailed to the trees) to find your way back out.

The cache you are looking for an ammo can (the funnest to find), and waiting for the FTF is an unactivated Kids and Caching Geocoin. Keep it, or activate it and send it out.

Pictures of the finders would be greatly appreciated by my daughter.

D1.0/T1.5
DESC: Located in the Pine Hills Recreation Area near the McGee picnic area
My girls and I love to get out and hike, and it?s always better when we can combine a geocache hunt with our explorations. This cache is near McGee Hill, and affords a great view of the La Rue swamp. While you?re up here, pick a trail and explore some of the area. There is some great old growth forest up here.

This is the second cache dedicated to the older of my adopted daughters, the quiet one. Some people don?t appreciate the gifts they?re given in this life, and those gifts are taken away and entrusted to someone who will care for them. We opened our home and our hearts to her and her sister so they could stay together, and we?re richer for it. So this one is for my girls, who?ve changed my Destiny as surely I?ve changed theirs.

This cache is an ammo can ? our favorite since it can hold lots of treasure. Awaiting the FTF is a Mermaid Swag geocoin (I call the older of my little geocaching partners my ?Mermaid Princess). The coin is unactivated, and can be kept or activated and sent out.
I may come back and add a camera to the cache, but if you have one with you the girls would love to see pics of the finders of their ?treasures.?

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D1.0/T2.0
DESC: This cache should be easy to find unless you are in a wheechair.  Park off the main road, heavy truck traffic at times.
The cache is a 35mm film canister, BYOP.

Near the site of this cache is an old settlement named Shetlerville.  &quot;Shetlerville was settled by Joseph Shetler. Joseph migrated to America from Bavarian Germany at the age of 21. He came down the Ohio River and settled in a small community known as Parkinson?s Landing. It is located four miles down the river from Rosiclare. It became Hardin County?s largest shipping port exporting potatoes, wheat, corn and beans.

During the 1800?s Shetlerville was a thriving community with more population and businesses than Cave-In-Rock, Elizabethtown or Rosiclare (the other river towns in Hardin County)

Some of the early settlers were Parkinsons, Shetlers, Herrmanns, Humms, Sieners, Rotes, Zimmers, Kochs, Foes, Smocks and Andersons. Many of them from Germany. While the thriving business community of Shetlerville is gone, many of their descendents are residents in Hardin County [and Pope County] today.&quot;

Some of the place names near here are named after the early settlers.

This cache is named after Mary Rotes Siener who was born and lived near here.

 <sym>Earthcache</sym>
 <desc>The Tiptonville Dome Earthcache by Influence Waterfowl Calls
Cache ID: GC1J9F4
Earthcache
SIZE: Not chosen
D1.0/T1.5
DESC: Welcome to Tiptonville in Lake County, TN!



The Tiptonville Dome is the area between the red line (the
Reelfoot Fault) and the blue line (St Johns Fault) in the picture
above. Reelfoot Lake is in lower right, formed when the area at
left end of lake (between the two faults) was raised 15-30 feet by
an earthquake uplift. The lake area has dropped as much as 20 feet.
Imagine the area between the two lines uplifted, while the areas to
the left of the blue line and the area right of the red line
lowered. There was not near as much movement to the left of the
blue line as there was to the right of the red line which formed
Reelfoot Lake. Quakes in centuries prior to 1811-12 probably caused
some of the uplift and drop but the quake in 1812 was the one that
caused enough rise in the Tiptonville area and drop in the lake
area to form the lake.
This rise between the faults caused temporary river waterfalls
where the Mississippi ran backwards during 1811-12 earthquakes. It
happened early on Feb. 7, 1812, when a thrust fault created a
sudden dam several feet high in the bottom of the river loop near
New Madrid.



The main section of river that reversed direction was from
island 10 northward about 10 miles to island 8. It lasted for a few
hours, though the new dams/waterfalls lasted for a few days, and
ruined several flatboats.
There are three basic types of earthquake faults. The
descriptions are as follows?
Dip-slip faults have walls that move up or down. That means that
at the fault is either pushed together (a reverse dip-slip fault)
or it is pulled apart (a normal dip-slip fault). A dip-slip fault
has a hanging wall and a footwall. A normal dip-slip fault?s
hanging wall slips down the footwall as the fault is pulled apart.
A reverse dip-slip fault?s hanging wall slips up the footwall as
the fault is pushed together.
Strike-slip faults have walls that move sideways, not up or
down. That is, the slip occurs along the strike, not up or down the
dip. In these faults the fault plane is usually vertical, so there
is no hanging wall or footwall. The forces creating these faults
are lateral or horizontal, carrying the sides past each other.
The last is called an oblique-slip fault. It has characteristics
of both the dip-sip and the strike-slip faults all rolled into one.
Because most faults have movement in both directions, both
directions of slip must be measurable to be labeled an oblique-slip
fault.
Knowing that the area called the Tiptonville dome has been
raised as a result of earthquakes one would easily conclude that we
are dealing with dip-slip faults here. The disappointing fact is
that at this time none of the faults in the area are visible and
are deep under ground. This being said the coords above will take
you to a bench mark in the lawn of the Court House in Tiptonville.
This bench mark disk was placed to record the elevation at that
point on earth but also records the elevation at that point in time
as it is inevitable that someday this ?dome? will rise again!
To prove you visited this site post a picture of you and your
GPSr at the benchmark when you log your find and to show the
educational value of this earthcache email me the answer to the
question below and your result of the required activity.
According to the wikipedia page about earth quake faults the
name of the Tiptonville dome could be put another way. What other
word could replace ?dome? in describing the area between the two
faults that was raised.
Record the elevation of the bench mark by placing your GPSr on
the benchmark with the elevation page showing. Then take a close up
picture so that you can read the elevation.
Email the answer and the elevation and post the pictures on the
listing when you log your find.

Been a while since I have found an earthcache.  Held up on doing this cache since my camera broke during the kayak trip in July.  Borrowed cachestalker94&apos;s camera to get the necessary requirement.

Some activity at the courthouse this morning, I guess there is court with the number of people outside.  

There is some difference between the elevation at my home and Tiptonville which is about 40 miles away.

2009-11-30 Leprechaun49, We made this one much tougher than it should have been.   First we pulled into the parking area and along came a car and pulled up to the business.     We waited while the occupant went to the door, discovered the store wasn&apos;t open till 2:00 p.m. then returned to his car and left.    Then as we started looking the trash removal service arrived to pick up the huge dumpster that happened to be parked about 6 feet from our Jeep.    They backed up, emptied the dumpster (left my Jeep, whew!) and left after exchanging a few pleasant greetings.  Then we proceeded to search for the cache.   Being Catholic is a definite advantage on this hunt.  Found the cache, signed the log and left before any more visitors joined us.

DESC: It just off highway 61 in Scott County, MO. During the winter there
is little to no bushwhacking required, however, during the summer
it may be overgrown as the cemetery is no longer under any kind of
management.
You are looking for an aspirin size camo&apos;ed bottle with a log and
big enough to hold one or two small items. FTF will find a log and
a key chain or message clip. BYOP A cemetery that is recognized by
many different names but more commonly by the family names
McMullin/Marshall. It is cleared of overgrowth by various locals
every few years. Like most cemeteries, it is pretty flat but can be
very muddy as it is right now. The last burial here was in
1943...most of the standing headstones are no longer readable and
there is a stack of broken and removed headstones on the southern
edge of it. Take a little time to walk around it as it is truly
beautiful look back on small town USA. 
PLEASE NOTE: I see, two people have now found the cache
around 30ish feet off from the coordinates and I don&apos;t live there
but visit often, I would appreciate it if anyone who goes to find
this can please send me an email with the coordinates of where they
find it and what kind of item you found it located at/in. I had
placed this cache in one location and then changed my mind and
believe I may have put the first location coordinates in the
posting. My mother-in-law lives just down the street but does not
have a GPS to get the coordinates for me. I will do a waypoint
correction or disable the cache shortly if I can&apos;t get it corrected
soon. That said, despite the coordinates being off, it is still a
fairly small area to search and should still be a pretty simple
find. Thank you for visiting the area and helping me get this
figured out.

 <sym>Earthcache</sym>
 <desc>Four Rivers by kodiak_62
Cache ID: GC1JMHX
Earthcache
SIZE: Not chosen
D2.0/T3.0
DESC: This area is known as the 4 Rivers area. (Ohio, Cumberland,
Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers join together within 40 miles of
here) This could cause major flooding if the water can not do
downstream. Looking for river gages at river front in Paducah, KY.

The Ohio River is the largest tributary by volume of the
Mississippi River. It is approximately 981 miles (1,579 km) long
and is located in the eastern United States. 
The river is formed by the confluence of the Allegheny and
Monongahela rivers at Point State Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
From Pittsburgh, it flows northwest through Allegheny and Beaver
Counties, before making an abrupt turn to the south-southwest at
the West Virginia?Ohio?Pennsylvania triple state line, from which
point it forms the border between West Virginia and Ohio, upstream
of Wheeling, West Virginia.
The river then follows a roughly southwest and then
west-northwest course before bending to a west-southwest course for
most of its length. It flows along the borders of West Virginia,
Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois, until it joins the
Mississippi near the city of Cairo, Illinois.
The Ohio&apos;s drainage basin covers 189,422 square miles (490,603
km²), including the eastern-most regions of the Mississippi Basin.
States drained by the Ohio include:
Illinois (the southeast quarter of the state),
Indiana (all but the northern area of the state),
Ohio (the southern half of the state),
New York (a small area of the southern border along the headwaters
of the Allegheny River),
Pennsylvania (a corridor from the southwestern corner to north
central border),
Maryland (a small corridor along the Youghiogheny River on the
state&apos;s western border),
West Virginia (all but the eastern panhandle of the state),
Kentucky (all but a small part in the extreme west of the state
drained directly by the Mississippi River),
Tennessee (all but a small part in the extreme west of the state
drained directly by the Mississippi River and a small area in the
southeastern corner of the state which is drained by the Conasauga
River),
Virginia (most of Southwest Virginia),
North Carolina (the western quarter of the state),
Georgia (the northwest corner of the state),
Alabama (the northern portion of the state), and
Mississippi (the northeast corner of the state).
The river had great significance in the history of the Native
Americans. It was a primary transportation route during the
westward expansion of the early U.S. It flows through or along the
border of six states, and its drainage basin encompasses 14 states,
including many of the states of the southeastern U.S. through its
largest tributary, the Tennessee River. During the nineteenth
century, it was the southern boundary of the Northwest Territory,
thus serving as the border between free and slave territory. It is
sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mason-Dixon line&quot; as it is commonly
acknowledged as the western natural extension of the original
Mason-Dixon line that divided Pennsylvania and Delaware from
Maryland and West Virginia (then a part of Virginia) thus being the
unofficial, and at times disputed, border between the Northern
United States and the American South or upland South.
The Ohio River is young from a geologic standpoint. The river
formed on a piecemeal basis beginning between 2.5 and 3 million
years ago. The earliest Ice Ages occurred at this time and dammed
portions of north flowing rivers. The Teays River was the largest
of these rivers, and the modern Ohio River flows within segments of
the ancient Teays. The ancient rivers were rearranged or consumed
by glaciers and lakes.
The upper Ohio River formed when one of the glacial lakes
overflowed into a south flowing tributary of the Teays River. The
overflowing lake carved through the separating hill and connected
the rivers. The resulting floodwaters enlarged the small Marietta
valley to a size more typical of a large river. The new large river
subsequently drained glacial lakes and melting glaciers at the end
of several Ice Ages. The valley grew with each major Ice Age.
The middle Ohio River formed in a manner similar to formation of
the upper Ohio River. A north-flowing river was
temporarily dammed southwest of present-day Louisville, Kentucky,
creating a large lake until the dam burst. A new route was carved
to the Mississippi River, and eventually the upper and middle
sections combined to form what is essentially the modern Ohio
River.

Because the Ohio River flowed westwardly, it became the convenient
means of westward movement by pioneers traveling from western
Pennsylvania. After reaching the mouth of the Ohio, settlers would
travel north on the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri.
There, some continued on up the Missouri River, some up the
Mississippi, and some further west over land routes. In the early
19th century, pirates, such as Samuel Mason, settled at
Cave-In-Rock, Illinois, waylaid travelers on their way down the
river, killed them, stole their goods, and scuttled their boats.
The folktales of Mike Fink recall the keelboats used for commerce
in the early days of European settlement. In 1843 the Ohio river
boatmen were the inspiration for Dan Emmett&apos;s The Boatman&apos;s
Dance.
Because it is the Southern border of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois,
the Ohio River was a part of the border that divided free states
and slave states in the years before the American Civil War. The
expression &quot;sold down the river&quot; originated as a lament of Kentucky
slaves being split apart from their families and sold in Louisville
and other Kentucky locations to be shipped via the Ohio River down
to New Orleans to be sold yet again to owners of cotton and sugar
field plantations.
The charter for Virginia went not to the middle of the Ohio
River but to its far shore, so that the entire river was included
in the lands owned by Virginia. Therefore, where the river serves
as a boundary between states, the entire river belongs to the
states on the east and then the south, i.e., West Virginia and
Kentucky, that were divided from Virginia. It is for that reason
that Wheeling Island, the largest inhabited island in the Ohio
River, belongs to West Virginia, even though it is much closer to
the Ohio shore than to the West Virginia shore. Kentucky brought
suit against Indiana in the early 1980s because of the building of
the Marble Hill nuclear power plant in Indiana, which would have
discharged its waste water into the river. The U.S. Supreme Court
held that Kentucky&apos;s jurisdiction (and, implicitly, that of West
Virginia) extended only to the low water mark of 1793 (important
because the river has been extensively dammed for navigation, so
that the present river bank is north of the old low water mark.)
Similarly in the 1990s, Kentucky disputed Illinois&apos; right to
collect taxes on a riverboat casino docked in Metropolis, citing
their control of the entire river. Aztar opened their own casino
riverboat that docked in Evansville, Indiana at about the same
time. Although cruises on the Ohio river were at first done in an
oval pattern up and down the Ohio, the state of Kentucky soon
protested and cruises were limited to going forwards then reversing
and going backwards on the Indiana shore only. The riverboat casino
never leaves the shore now.
Water levels for the Ohio River are predicted daily by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The water
depth predictions are relative to each local flood plain based upon
predicted rainfall in the Ohio River basin in five reports as
follows:
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Hannibal Dam, Ohio (including the
Allegheny and Monongahela rivers),
Willow Island Dam, Ohio, to Greenup Dam, Kentucky (including the
Kanawha River),
Portsmouth, Ohio, to Markland Locks and Dam, Kentucky,
McAlpine Locks and Dam, Kentucky, to Cannelton Locks and Dam,
Indiana,
Newburgh Dam, Indiana, to Golconda, Illinois.



So what does all of this have to do with this gaging stations?
As mentioned earlier, the Ohio River drains over 189,422 square
miles (121,230,080 acres) and therefore is a major waterway for the
Ohio River basin. Since it flows almost 1,000 miles, rain in one
area can drastically affect this area. With more and more houses
and roads being built, the rainwater does not have a chance to soak
into the ground. This area has suffered many flooding events from
snow melts upstream when Paducah had no snow all winter.
Below is a link to this gaging station:

To log this earthcache, you must do the following (TWO SEPARATE
PICTURES REQUIRED):
1. Take picture #1 of yourself (face and GPS in the picture)
with the gage house visible in the background. This is to be a
picture as close to the gage house as possible. Do not get on
steps.
2. Post in your log what the heights of the River is and what
the flow in thousand cubic feet per second is (found on the
website).
3. Email me with the following information:
At what river height would water start running in your shoes at
ground zero?
4. You are standing near the levee system that protects the
town. The most current, high level recorded was in 1997. Estimate
the river&apos;s depth by pointing to the staff gage if the river were
at that record flood level and take a picture (#2) and post it in
your log.
Hint: Incline gage is on boat ramp. Gage house near flood wall. Staff gage is on flood wall.

2009-11-01 kodiak_62, The structure is still there ! ! ! ! ! Ground zero is where you will find an incline gage to see what the water level will be when water runs into your shoes. The gage house structure is 380&apos; NW of Ground Zero. I visited the site today and I am glad the Earthcache is still available to find. Good Luck on your learning experience.

2009-10-18 kodiak_62, I will visit this site and see if I can modify the photo requirements so everyone can claim this Earthcache.

2009-10-10 kodiak_62, The posted coordinates take you to ground zero where water would run into your shoes. You should be able to get a water level reading there. In the short distance, you&apos;ll locate the gage house and staff gage. Hope you get to visit this area again to finish this earthcache.

Cache ID: GC1JPZA
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: This is a medium size lock-n-lock containing a log, FTF, and various &quot;tools of the trade&quot;.
Take the left at the Y at the CCMA building.  There is no need to enter any plant property or cross any fence!  Parking is at N 37 3.565  W 88 21.275.

This cache is located at the site of the old Haddox Ferry that ran from Calvert City in Marshall County across the Tennessee River to Livingston County.  The ferry was started by Howard and Mary Haydock Kuykendall and his wife&apos;s brother, Gideon Haydock of Smithland.  It was originally known as Haydock&apos;s Ferry and the road on the other side of the river is still called Haydock&apos;s Ferry Road..

The Church of Christ at Calvert City baptized its first members at Haddox ferry in 1914.

The plant on your right as you face the river is CC Metals and Alloys.  It began in the 1940s as Pittsburgh Metallurgical.  It now makes specialty ferrosilicons, an alloy of iron and silicon.

The plant on your left is Arkema, which began operation in 1948 as Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company.  They make refrigerant gas and engineered plastics (think fancy teflon).

This place is a city park mostly used now by fishermen putting their boats in the river.  The picnic pavillion is nice on a &quot;nice&quot; day, but I nearly froze the day I placed the cache.

Keep an eye out for wildlife any day you&apos;re here.  Eagles are known to fly along the river.  And deer, turkey, fox, skunks, owls, and hawks are regular visitors.

Be aware that putting your hands on this one can be a little difficult.  Children, the physically challenged, or persons of small stature may need assistance.  Warn little ones to stay away from the edge of the bank as it drops off very steeply.  Also, in spite of what the google map shows, it is NOT in the river.

2009-07-27 deercreekth, I greatly approve of the location of this cache.  I can remember admiring the canon as a child.  My Dad&apos;s work sometimes had their company picnics at the American Legion building.  I took swimming lessons at the pool here, played on the playground here, rode my bike here, picked up buckeyes here, and later cruised around here in my teenage years.  It&apos;s sad to see that the park now closes at night.  When I was a teenager there were two things to do in this town at night-- cruise the park or go somewhere and drink.  I spent my time cruising the park.  At least the Wal Mart is open 24 hours now so there&apos;s an alternative to the other choice.

I didn&apos;t think I was going to come up with the cache.  I spent several minutes looking and kept thinking I had found it only to discover that I had found a part of the canon that just happens to look like a small container.  I had ticked off a wasp that has a nest on it, and was just about to give up when I finally spotted it.  I&apos;ve never seen one of these containers used for a cache.  It seems to be working well.  Thanks for the hide.

2009-05-07 RickBlick &amp; Chick, Yaaaay for # 1500

I chose this cache for a variety of reasons for this milestone.  First, each of our milestones has been a mountain of some kind or another because I like to climb.  This started to fit the bill with the &apos;Ridge&apos; in the name.  Secondly, the terrain was rated at 4, so i knew I&apos;d be happy with a little bit of a climb.
Third;  This cache had a little extra twist in being a letterbox highbrid.  Also, in reading the logs, the coords looked to be just a tad off, adding to the difficulty factor.  These are all good things for our milestones.  Finnaly, being along the &apos;Rails to Trails&apos; path, meant Tammy could walk along for at least part of the way.

So here we are, after caching our way through Tennesee and into Kentucky.  This is our 5th find in Kentucky, and our 15th find of the day.  We reach milestone find # 1500 overlooking the &apos;Wingo Rails to Trails&apos; path.  I relax after a difficult day with 3 DNFs and take a couple pictures with the Anna Mull TB that I&apos;ve been showing around.  At this point I notice my GPSr says that I&apos;m 80 feet from the cache.  Others had mentioned 50, so I&apos;m glad I read some logs, or I might have had to look for another Mountain to climb.

Found it
2009-01-23 CyclonicKWF, It was a beautiful 60 degree day in January.  What better way to spend it than to go searching for caches.  I tried getting regnad to join me but he was busy doing adviser work with the group he advises on campus.  I headed off on my own.  

After finding the historical Fallen From the Sky cache I headed towards Mayfield.  I knew there were some new caches there.  I could also continue on and get the new ones along the Wingo Rail to Trail.  

I saved this one for my last cache along the Wingo Trail since the Muggles I encountered earlier were still near as I passed it the first time.  I hoped noone would be around when I came back.  As I neared the cache location I noticed what looked to be a dog off in the distance on the trail.  Then I saw another 4 legged creature appear behind it.  I pulled out my camera and super zoomed in to find that it was 2 deer.  One of them stared out me as I took pictures.  Finally they decided to head back in the woods.  Turns out they were at about the location of the cache.  

Upon arriving at the location and looking at the terrain I realized that this was going to be like some of the caches Titansfan has along this trail.  I had to look for the best way to maneuver up the hill.   I chose an ascent route further South.  I figured I could walk the along the top by the fence.  There was not much room between the side of the hill and the fence so I actually did not pay to much attention to the GPS.  I was holding on for my dear life.  I noticed a location that looked familiar so I headed to it. Sure enough the cache was there.  After carefully but quickly signing the cache I slipped and slid my way back down via a different path.  It was not until I got back to the car that I realized I had not checked the stamp out and I had not checked the coordinates.  

Thanks for the Cache!

This is a great trail if you need to just get out and away from the rat race.  there are picnic tables at both ends of the trail if you would like to have a picnic.  So come out to enjoy the trail, find some caches, and don&apos;t forget their are some Waymarks to pick up as well!

After finding the historical Fallen From the Sky cache I headed towards Mayfield.  I knew there were some new caches there.  I could also continue on and get the new ones along the Wingo Rail to Trail.  

After finding the first new caches on the trail and encountering some Muggles, I figured I should head farther down the trail.  I went after the new cache towards the end of the trail thinking I would not have to walk to the end.   Once I made it to the location I realized I may not have had to walk to the end, but I could see the end from the location.  

I read some of the previous logs and thought I would have trouble finding it.  I was determined to look about 30 feet from the location.  After searching for a few minutes I followed my GPS and it lead me right to the cache.  Tricky hide if you are not looking in the right location.  I do get why the cache is called &quot;Field Trip&quot;.  I signed the log and headed to the next cache.

We grabbed a few caches and a bite to eat while in Perryville.  This one took us a while - the GPS was jumping around a bit.  Ken finally came up with it.  TFTC.

This cache is located at Perryville Higher Education center. It is a college that is a branch off of Mineral Area College. It is a very small college building. I have permission from the school director. She just asks that people be very sneaky and quiet especially while school is going on. Please try not to be noticed when attempting this cache because there will be a lot of kids going to school. Good luck and lets get some bugs moving.

This cache is in the Perryville Park and it is located pretty close to highway 61. It is a small preform painted to match the suroundings. Please screw the lid back on tight so that no water gets in. Good luck to all cachers.

We got lucky on this one, because it was pitch dark, and there were lots of places you could have hidden this one. Denmother saw a shadow, and that was the container.

2009-10-25 mmeese, Found while OCW MMAPgirl.

We found this cache pretty quickly, which is surprising, since I tend to have a lot of trouble with caches of this type.

When we got back to our car it would not start. Two young men drove up, and asked if they could help. We declined their assistance since I thought I could pop start it and we would be on our way.
A few minutes later after failing to pop start the car, a family pulled up and asked if they could help. By that time we discovered the loose battery connection. The gentleman jiggled the wire as I started the car. He gave directions to a store where I could buy a pliers or something to tighten up the cable.

You meet the nicest people in Perryville Park !!

This cache is in need of repair.  I am out of the country until August of 2010.  Also this area is hazardous due to the wind storm back in May, 2009.  Lots of hanging limbs.  It is ill advised to seek this cache.  Use extreme caution.

Difficulty is a &quot;2&quot; due to potential muggle activity nearby.
This cache is placed in honor of the former cache &quot;Doc Hicks Dream&quot; and the former town of Lone Oak.  This area was an apple orchard before Doc Hicks had his dream and is now a major athletic area from April to October.  The tiny community of Lone Oak was incorporated as a city in 1979 and then dissolved in 2008.  Lone Oak High School, first established in 1919, is due to consolidate with the county&apos;s other two high schools in 2012.  However, the community of Lone Oak will continue to exist.

Parking is available at:
1) N37  02.294  W088  40.657 or
2) N37  02.278  W088  40.588.

Cache is a small plastic tube. Contents include a log-book, a pen, and a TB.

Please re-hide as found if not better.

Check the back of the log book for a bonus.

Didn&apos;t find it
2009-03-19 GEO.JOE, I hunted for about 20 min with no luck. With all of the limbs down from the Ice Strom I think it was harder than finding a needle in a hay stack. At least with a needle I could have jumped in and dug around until I got poked - those needles will eventually give away their hiding spots  [:D]

The area is a mess with all the limbs and I just lost interest in moving all the sticks so I could look or even walk around. The trail is clear to just past the signal lights but they just moved the debris off to the sides of the trail.
I will be back in the area and hopefully the trail and sides of the trail will be clear by the time I get back.

After finding the historical Fallen From the Sky cache I headed towards Mayfield.  I knew there were some new caches there.  I could also continue on and get the new ones along the Wingo Rail to Trail.  

Jungleboy, you dirty dastardly devil, that was not very nice.  [:P] The coordinates initially had me over on the other side of the creek.  I finally made it to the right area.  After searching for awhile I had to use my PAF.  Once I was reassured I was searching in the right location I then was able to narrow my search.  I finally found the cache.

This cache is located on the Southern Illinois University campus and is next to one of my favorite places in all the world.

There will be few muggles in the immediate vicinity unless an event is going on.  In that case, stealth is a must!  During SIU home basketball games, this area is priority parking, so you will have to walk a little bit.  Otherwise parking is not a problem and you could actually drive to within 10-15 yards of the cache.  Happy hunting, and EAT EM UP, EAT EM UP, S  I  U!!!!!!!

P.S. - I have included two tickets to an upcoming SIU men&apos;s basketball home game for the FTF.

 <name>Signal Point Bluff </name>
 <sym>Traditional Cache</sym>
 <desc>Signal Point Bluff  by GEO.JOE
Cache ID: GC1KPMG
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T2.5
DESC: Here is a bit of history with a half mile walk along the base of a
very scenic bluff that has been sculpted by wind and water with an
alcove and washes to admire and explore.
Signal Point was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Residents of
the nearby community of Liberty would light fires on top of Signal
Point to guide runaway slaves. The residents would shelter, feed
and care for the escaped slaves and assist them in moving further
north. 
 

I am not 100% sure this is Signal Point but this is the bluff that
the park map shows as Signal Bluff and I was told by a ranger
Signal Point is above this slick rock wash. My Topo map shows
Signal point about .5 mile south-east in someone?s back yard. I am
not surprised the Topo has a point of interest a little off, I have
found it to be up to 4 miles off. Part of my confusion on this
location is that this valley runs east-west and the bluff faces
north. However runaway slaves would have come from the south. It
does not seem to be the best orientation so that someone could see
the fire from very far away. I guess until I know differently I
will have to go with what I have been told. You never know we might
be making history here (or at least help change it a bit : ) I will
keep exploring and encourage anyone that is interested to explore
south of here to see if you can find a more logical location.

 

This hike is almost 2 miles round trip, it is not difficult walking
but there are some ups and downs. The trailhead is located at (N37
24.223 W88 38.571). There is no formal parking space but there is
plenty of room along the side of the gravel road near the
trailhead. Follow the trail in until you get to a slick rock
descent that takes you to the base of the bluff (N37 24.407 W88
38.678). The cache is located on top of the bluff but I recommend
walking in and out along the base of the bluff because it is much
more scenic. You will have to follow the bluff until it about ends.
Just after you pass under the cache location you can choose to go
up a rock fall/drain near (N37 24.117 W88 39.149) or follow the
trail 50-60 yards further to the top of the bluff. After finding
the cache you are welcome to follow the 4-wheeler trail out along
the top of the bluff but there really isn?t much to see and it is
only 700 ft closer. 
 

To get to the trailhead: From Dixon Springs State Park travel 1.5
miles east on Hwy 146 then turn north, I am not sure of the name of
the road but your GPS should be pointing North to the parking
coordinates. Travel north 1.6 miles and park to the side of the
road at the trailhead (four wheeler trail). 
 
 There is a second option for approaching this cache if you are
camping at Lake Glendale or would like to hike in from Lake
Glendale. This option is 2.4 miles round trip. This trail does
include .4 total miles of off trail hiking. The trailhead is
located at N37 24.361 W88 39.430. The first .2 mile is a nice wide
graveled trail. Just past a trail juncture you will start looking
for Red/Orange painted spots on the trees. You will follow the
painted trees .20 miles off trail through the woods to the base of
signal bluff, below the cache. When you reach the base of the bluff
you go right to get to the top of the bluff to reach the cache. And
go left to explore the base of the bluff. You will return on the
same path you walked in on. The trailhead is along the road to the
group campground (through the gate past the campground). If you
want to park along the side of the road near the trail head, then
stop at the camp host to let them know what you are doing. If no
one is at the camp host trailer place a note on your dash to inform
them what you are doing.

2009-01-10 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on a cold cloudy weekend in Southern illinois. We were the [i]beta[/i] testers for this cache, checking the notes and walking the trails, reporting what we liked and where we could have used more help. Joe has incorporated all that and more into the notes and we can heartily recommend this one to future cachers. 

We hiked below the bluff and were treated to spectacular views that we would have missed had we taken the bluff-top trail. There were some muddy spots at the beginning of the trail but overall, it was a comfortable hike. We looked a little longer for the cache than we expected, but the hint has been amended to make the find easier. Two thumbs up! Thanks, GEO.JOE, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

DESC: Second in a series of &quot;Flach Caches&quot; placed for the LOHS Geocachers.  You are looking for a small &quot;buffalo tube&quot; containing log only, so BYOP.
The cache location is at the former pauper&apos;s cemetery in McCracken County before it was moved to Wilmington in West Paducah.  See &quot;Wilmington 2&quot; (GCV60P). 

The cache is also near what was the Sanatorium or County Farm. It was was built in the early 1900s and used to house the poor elderly farmers who no longer had living family to take care of them. The County Farm was open for about forty years. It closed in the late thirties or early forties. After the sanatorium closed, it was out of use until about 1970. In 1970 the McCracken County School Board began to use it as offices. The offices have now moved to a new location, and the 100 year old Gregorian style buildings have been removed.

In the fall, you can come and see LOHS&apos;s very own &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; nearby.  Cheer as the mighty Flashes WELCOME visiting teams TO THE GRAVEYARD.

There is no need to enter the cemetery to find the cache.  Parking is readily available nearby for this grab and go.

Check the back of the log book for a bonus.

Cache ID: GC1KH9K

SIZE: Not chosen
D1.0/T1.0
DESC: Kentucky and Barkley Lakes are connected by the Barkley Canal. The canal is located in Grand Rivers and is 1.75 miles in length. The canal provides a navigable channel for both commerce and recreation craft moving on the two waterways.
The Tennessee and Cumberland watersheds are connected by the Barkley Canal, which intersects the Tennessee River at mile 25.3 and the Cumberland River at mile 32.8. It as a bottom width of 400 feet and became navigable in 1967. 

The land to the south and north of this location is a rough, hilly area that defines the western margin of the Pennyroyal Plateau. This area is developed on cherty Lower and Middle Mississippian limestones, deeply buried in places by resistant and unconsolidated Upper Cretaceous Period gravels. This is a period of geologic time from 145 to 65 million years ago. Rocks of this age in Kentucky are only found at the Land Between the Lakes and in eastern parts of the Jackson Purchase. The area lacks the karst features found to the east of Lake Barkley in the Pennyroyal region which has numerous many faults acting as conduits for mineral-dissolving waters. 

In 1944 the dam on the Tennessee River was completed to create Kentucky Lake, which is visible to the west. Look to the east to view Lake Barkley which was created in the early 1960s when a dam was constructed on the Cumberland River, only a couple of miles from Kentucky Dam. Both reservoirs are operated as a unit for flood control and the production of hydroelectric power. Empoundment of the Kentucky and Barkly Lakes have greatly increased the alluvial deposits in the channels as well as the low-lying shorelines. Alluvium is the general term for clay, silt, sand, and gravel deposited during relatively recent geologic time by streams or other bodies of running water. 

The Cumberland River is 688 miles (1,106 km) long, draining
approximately 18,000 square miles. It starts in eastern Kentucky on the Cumberland Plateau, flows through southeastern Kentucky and crosses into northern Tennessee, and then curves back up into western Kentucky before draining into the Ohio River at Smithland, Kentucky. 

The Tennessee River is the largest tributary of the Ohio River. It is approximately 652 miles (1049 km) long, draining approximately 40,000 square miles. It has its beginnings in eastern Tennessee, flows south through northern Alabama, then turns north to flow through western Tennessee and Kentucky before draining into the Ohio River at Paducah, Ky. The river was once popularly known as the Cherokee River. 

Sixteen miles to the northwest is the Ohio River. The Ohio River is the largest tributary by volume of the Mississippi River. It is approximately 981 miles (1,579 km) long. 

The Cumberland, the Tennessee, and the Ohio are the three major Kentucky rivers. 

Facing the canal, you can see to your left the &apos;Between the Rivers Memorial Bridge&apos; connecting with the peninsula of Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area created in the
1960&apos;s. 

For more information about the geology of this area and Kentucky visit: http://www.uky.edu/KGS/ to Kentucky Geological Survey.


SUCCESSFULLY LOG THIS EARTHCACHE: 

A. Stand in front of the &apos;informaton stand&apos; and upload a picture of yourself with the canal in the background. 

B. Email me the answer to the two questions below: 

1) Determine the water level of the canal;  give the time and date of the measurement also. 

2) Technically speaking the land you are standing on is surrounded by water...Barkley Canal and the three rivers mentioned above. So what type of land form are your standing on, technically speaking? 

3) What is karst topography and why are karst features absent from the &quot;land between the rivers?

 <desc>The World&apos;s Only Inland Cape by Gone2theDogs
Cache ID: GC1KRCT
Earthcache
SIZE: Not chosen
D1.0/T2.5
DESC: Cape Rock is located in Cape Rock Park and you can drive to within 150 feet of the earth cache.  The last 150 feet are paved, but the incline is rather steep.
Cape Rock, located on the western bank of the Mississippi River at Cape Girardeau, Missouri, is the only inland bay in the world, and served as a defining feature in the development of the State of Missouri and the City of Cape Girardeau, as well as Cape Girardeau County.  

&quot;Cape&quot; is another word for a headland, which is an area of land adjacent to water on three sides.  A large headland may also be called a peninsula.  Long, narrow and high headlands may be called promontories.  When headlands significantly affect ocean currents they are often called capes.  The opposite to a headland is a bay which is a body of water surrounded by land on three sides.  

Cape Rock is the only example in the world of an inland cape occuring along the banks of a river, and it exists in the form of a promontory into the Mississippi River.  

In all other cases, a headland is a piece of land that juts into the sea from the main land coast line.  Headlands are shaped by erosion.  They are formed when the sea attacks a section of coast consisting of alternating bands of hard and soft waves.  The banks of soft rock such as sand and clay, erode more quickly than those of more resistant hard rock such as chalk.  This would form a headland, and did so at Cape Rock.

French soldier Jean Baptists Girardot was essential in the founding of the city of Cape Girardeau.  As he was traveling through the area, he found this promontory overlooking the Mississippi River and chose this location to establish a trading post to serve the more than 20 Indian tribes that lived in the area.  Trappers and travelers also discovered &quot;Cape Girardot&quot;, and the city of Cape Girardeau, and Cape Girardeau County grew up around the trading post.  

After Ensign Girardot moved on in search of other discoveries, the Spanish Governor sent Louis Lorimier to establish a military post at the former location of Girardot&apos;s trading post, and an attempt was made to rename the area Lorimont in his honor, the name &quot;Cape Girardot&quot; (laer modified to Girardeau) had already gained poopular acceptance among the region&apos;s population.  

Cape Rock Park is located in the northeast part of the city, adn the park contains 21.3 acres and offers a breathtaking view of the mighty Mississippi River.  The park was the original trading post established by Ensign Girardot.  Although part of the actual cape was destroyed in the 1800s to make room for the railroads, this memorial &quot;Cape Rock&quot; sits atop the bluff of Girardot&apos;s trading post.

 
To claim credit for this cache, please email the following information through our geocaching.com profile:

1.  What is the elevation at the base of the Cape Rock Memorial?

2.  A photo of your GPSr atop the memorial.  Please post this with your log rather than emailing it.

3.  Your estimation of the width of the Mississippi River at the point of the Cape.
Hint: You will not need any hints to find Cape Rock. You can also still see the railroad tracks that were laid in the 1800&apos;s when part of the promontory was destroyed.

2009-12-09 myotis, OCW K-Team and N0WNV.  Talk about a cold day!!!  And the wind!!  What a day to be caching-we must be insane.  In the teens and 50 mph winds.  Did I mention how cold it was?  We headed down to Perryville and the Cape and had a great and cold time.  Lots of really nice caches.  But it was cold.  Thanks for all the great caches.



I was wondering where Cape got its name.  Glad I now know

We made a swing in off the Interstate to check out this interesting Earthcache. We didn’t really even come close to blocking the road where we parked, but we got a couple of dirty looks from other visitors. The other visitors just made “drive-by” visits - at least we got out and looked around!

DESC: Located in the Clay City Park.
This is the first of several caches I am placing in what I call the WCCDI Project, Webster County Cache Density Intensification.  There are more in the works and will be coming along shortly!

This cache originally began as a featured stage to a multi-cache, but then I decided it would be best to keep it as a traditional cache.  You can park at one of the two nearest entrances to the park and the walk will be quite short.  This cache may be difficult to find without being spotted during baseball season.  The cache is hidden closest to the spot where the toddler&apos;s play, but you might be able to pull it off if you act like your having a picnic, and the spot isn&apos;t to bad for a picnic on the ground.  Have fun!

Hidden with permission from the city of Clay.

I got permission to place a cache in these woods from the owner and
his Dad lives near where you will park. I stopped in to check and
see if it was alright with him as well. He thought it would be
great and offered up a place three feet or so from his front porch.
I told him I would hide it in the woods though. If you see him say
thanks! 
The posted coords will take you to a power pole! This way you
will park in the right spot! Please park beside the natural gas
meter with your front bumper near the power pole. That way you wont
block his driveway or the driveway for the field.
On the pole there is some letters and numbers burned into it.
Use the second line to make a 3 digit number. The first digit is
the number of &quot;B&quot;s. The second digit is the number of &quot;P&quot;s. The
third digit is the number of &quot;C&quot;s. Now subtract that number from
both the north and west coords of the coords below to get on your
way! Just head east along his yard to the woods and let the GPSr do
the rest! Hey! Don&apos;t forget to keep a look out for Sasquatch! He
has been sighted in the area!

P.S. If by chance you have more than one vehicle he oked parking

road and his house. Make sure you pull in enough for him to get out
if he needs to while you are out there. Congrats to

 <sym>Earthcache</sym>
 <desc>Tower Rock by Gone2theDogs
Cache ID: GC1KREF
Earthcache
SIZE: Not chosen
D1.0/T2.0
DESC: Tower Rock is located near Altenburg, Missouri, and you can drive
to within a tenth of a mile of this geological formation. You will
not be able to reach the rock without the use of a geovessel or
unless river depth at Chester, IL , is nearly zero.
You will be able to make your observations from the parking area
that the coordinates will take you to. To reach Tower Rock parking,
take Route A east from Uniontown to County Road 460 and follow this
road south to the area. 

Tower Rock, located in the middle of the Mississippi River near
Altenburg, MO, is a small limestone island carved by the mighty
river. Although no written history of Tower Rock exists to tell us
exactly how it was formed, theories include: erosion due to tides
and currents;  earthquakes which are common along the New Madrid
Fault and have resulted in the Mississippi flowing backwards;  and a
combination thereof. Its ¼ acre is covered by upland forest with
stands of oak-pine and oak-hickory-beech. The mainland offers an
amazing view of Tower Rock, although the island itself is
inaccessible except by boat. Tower Rock has been designated as a
National Historic Site and is owned by the Missouri Department of
Conservation. It is located 100 miles south of St. Louis.

The stately Grand Tower Rock, which gave its name to the tiny river
town across the river in Illinois, has stood for eons in the
Mississippi River, instilling fear in pilots, Indians, and
explorers. The 80-foot-tall block of galleon-shaped limestone,
capped by scrub oak and cedar, was accessible by land for the first
time in recorded history when the Mississippi reached an all-time
low in 1988 when a drought that humbled the once mighty Mississippi
sucked dry the strip of water that separates the island from the
Missouri side of the river. 

The channel that exists between Tower Rock and the Missouri side of
the river creates dangerous whirlpools that have been the ruin of
ships and barges over the centuries. The explorers Marquette and
Joliet were warned by Indians of the ?monster of the Mississippi?
and they erected a cross on top of Tower Rock to protect them from
the demons hiding at its base. 

Missionary Father Marquette and fur trader/explorer Joliet explored
the Mississippi River in 1673 by canoe for the French governor of
Canada. A St. Louis newspaper says Marquette was writing of Tower
Rock when his journal mentions a place that is dreaded by the
savages, because they believe that a demon is there that devours
travelers. ?This is the demon: there is a small cove, surrounded by
rocks 20 feet high, into which the whole current of the river
rushes, and, being pushed back against the waters following it, and
checked by an island near by, the current is compelled to pass
through a narrow channel. This is not done without a violent
struggle between all these waters, which force one another back, or
without a great din, which inspires terror in the savages, who fear
everything.? 

LeSalle passed by in 1682, followed more than a decade later by
three missionaries on their way to Quebec. In the writings of the
missionaries, this is one of the most outstanding things they
mention in the traveling up and down the river. Pirates did a lot
of ravaging, looting and killing at the base of Tower Rock because
keelboat passengers had to get out and walk because of the rapids
there and they would get attacked and robbed.

In Merriwether Lewis?s journal entries for November 26 and 26,
1803, he details his observations about Tower Rock. He observed
that the large isolated mass of rock stood in tehr iver close to
the western shore, and when the Mississippi was at a low stage, it
was possible to pass near to Tower Rock as the party did that
evening when it rounded the rock close on the east side on their
way to make camp immediately above. The party pulled ashore on the
western side just upstream from the famous Mississippi River
landmark. Lewis reported that the watermen of the Mississippi
regarded Grand Tower in much the same way that sailors did the
tropic or ?equanoxial? line. The tradition was that rivermen who
had never passed Grand Tower before were compelled to either
furnish spirits to drink or be dunked. Lewis rowed to the base of
the rock, where he got out and climbed to the top. 

In 1839, John Davis and Penelope Pike were married on the rock. The
wedding party of 10 was departing when their boat was caught in a
whirlpool. Only a slave who clung to the boat survived. 

Tower Rock originally included several pinnacles and rock
formations sticking up around it, and because the formations
presented formidable obstacles to river traffic, many of them were
blasted away in a quarrying operation in the mid-1800?s. According
to several written histories, President Ulysses S. Grant himself
stepped in to save the rock in 1871. Grant had gone up and down the
river here during the civil War, and he was familiar with the rock.
When they called his attention to the fact that they intended to
blast it away, he issued a presidential decree to save it for
public use. 

Even today, riverboat pilots fear Tower Rock. A towboat pilot is
quoted as saying that it?s really too dangerous to ?mess with? when
the river?s up because of the whirlpool caused by the force of the
water hitting the rock and shooting behind it. 

The general rule of thumb for access to the rock by foot is 0.0? on
the Chester, IL, river gage or 7.0? on the Cape Girardeau, MO,
river gage. However, upstream water releases by the Corps of
Engineers to maintain navigation depth can change the river level
at the rock by several feet within a few hours. 

To claim credit for this earth cache, email the answers to the
following questions through our Geocaching.com profile: 
1. What is the elevation of the parking area nearest the posted
coordinates? 
2. Describe the geological features of the area between the parking
and Tower Rock. 
3. Would you be willing to approach Tower Rock by water? By land at
low water level? 
4. Theorize as to whether you believe Tower Rock was formed by
erosion or by an earthquake and explain what you see that makes you
believe so. 5. If possible, please include a photo of your GPSr
with Tower Rock in the background.

The water depth was about 8 feet on the MO side just north of Tower Rock so we were able to pull right up and climb out without hitting bottom.  There were a couple of guys parked there getting ready to fish from the rocks and the skeeters were out BAD!  I will post the pics by the weekend.  Thanks for making come back the area.

2009-09-08 Satchamo 44, Answers on the way.  In Perryville to see the &quot;Tour of Missouri&quot; bike race, on my way to Cape Girardeau to see the end.  Took some time out to geocache my way there.  I haven&apos;t been to Tower Rock since I was a kid growing up in Perryville, so when I saw this earthcache posted, I thought, next time when I have extra time while in Perryville, I&apos;m going to go for this cache.  For some reason the roads don&apos;t seem as hilly and curvy as I remember as a kid, of course, I was in the back seat and not driving, so that may explain some of it.  Tower Rock hasn&apos;t changed much in the intervening years since I graduated from high school, now almost 50 years later.  Thank you for bringing me back to Tower Rock.
Found it
2009-09-05 joranda, This is my best earthcache visit to date. I came out here with my brother who had stopped here earlier in the year. I had the wild idea to do this by kayak so I brought both of them so me and cavscout could give it a shot by visiting the earthcache up close. Wild idea number two was when I put in on the illinois side to save time. I would not tell anyone to try that. It was my 43rd birthday today and wanted to test myself. The crossing started off well as I told cavscout to head across at a up river angle so we wouldn&apos;t miss the island. As we got close to the island the current had picked up and was getting ruff. Next thing you know, we was starting to pass the island and little whirl pools was forming around the back side. That is when I knew that this wasn&apos;t a great idea. We was able to get past the fast current and paddled to a safe place to pull in at. We did a lot of looking around on this rock. It is just hard to imagaine that it has been around this long. Thank you for taking the time and getting this earthcache published. Without you doing so, I would of never seen this wonder of mothernature. For anyone else, if you plan on visiting the island first hand, cross from the Missouri side and not the Illinois. The time it takes to drive around to Missouri is well worth your well being.

2009-09-05 Cav Scout, Today I visited this very cool EarthCache again with Joranda. This time I crossed by kayak from the Illinois side. This trip is certainly not for the faint of heart. As we crossed the river I could see the ripples in the water caused by the currents underneath going over the ancient sandstone formations and glacial loess. 

At first the crossing seemed as if we was going in a straight line, but half way across the Mississippi I realized I was being swept to the south by the strong currents. As I came within 100 yards of Tower Rock, the water became quicker and it seemed for a moment the Tower was moving to the right as I struggled to get closer to the base of the rock. I then seen something that scared the wits out of me. I saw whirlpools all around the south east side of the tower. I put more muscle into each stroke of my paddle and manuvered around the whirlpools. I dont know how strong they are, but I was not willing to take a chance to find out.

Once at the base of Tower Rock, Joranda and myself started to look for a way around so we could get to the top. The rope is still in place and strong as the day I was here earlier in the year. The top is really over grown with vines, thorns, and poison ivy but once you get through that stuff you will find that the view is spectacular.

This EarthCache is worth taking the time to discover, however, if you canoe or kayak, do it from the Missouri side.

Thanks for the adventure and giving me a reason to come back.

 <desc>Hardin County Fire Road #1 by SidewaysSam
Cache ID: GC1MWPE
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.5/T2.0
DESC: This is one of three caches placed on this old fire road.
This fire road skirts the outer edges of an area known as Hicks Dome.  Hicks Dome is an interesting geological feature in Hardin County. Some believe the dome may be related to an ancient meteor or comet impact, a part of the 38th parallel structures, a string of geological features running to Kansas. Some believe this to be a string of impact craters from a body that broke apart prior to hitting the earth. The Hicks Dome is underlain by ultramafic igneous rocks and igneous diatremes or breccia pipes. Most geologists currently accept the theory that the older rocks at the center of the uplift are related to this deep seated igneous activity. This igneous activity may have also provided the fluorine for the fluorspar deposits in this region.  Fluorspar, or calcium fluoride, was mined in Hardin County until the early 1990s.

DESC: Very interesting history to this area.
Before the settlement of Illinois, natives used a well beaten path to travel from their major settlements of near present day Equality, Shawneetown, and Tolu, Ky.  The first settlers came and used this trail for their wagon trains.  It became known as the Ford&apos;s Ferry to Vandalia Trail.  Ford&apos;s Ferry was the ferry crossing the Ohio River about 10 miles south, and was frequently used by the pioneer traveler.  Jim Ford and a man named William Potts worked together along this 10 mile stretch of road as robbers and murderers.  

William Potts and his wife owned a Tavern and Inn just north of the cache site (to the left of the grain bin).  The old road and Indian trail is still present in some parts of the countryside.  

William Potts would send a scout to the ferry operator to find out which travelers were wealthy.  Those deemed wealthy were noted and encouraged to stay at Potts Inn.  At some point during their stay, William would kill the travelers, and take their money.  William Potts had a son, Billy, that was witness to many of the burtal killings and even helped to bury those murdered in shallow graves nearby. When Billy was a teenager he got into some trouble along the road trying to rob a traveler.  He had to run away to avoid being killed.  

After several years of pirating on the Ohio, Billy decided to return to his parents home for a surprise visit.  He and a friend crossed Ford&apos;s Ferry and his father&apos;s spotter scouted them out, asking questions and learning of the money the travelers had.  This spotter told BIlly to stay at the Inn, and sent word that he was headed that way.  Billy wanted to see how his fathers operation was working, so he was going to keep his identity a secret.  He had gained a significant amount of weight and grown a full beard, so he wasn&apos;t recognizable to his parents when arriving.  

Billy knew his father would kill the travelers at night, so he decided to play it cool for a while.  Potts senior had became accustomed to asking the tired traveler if he wanted to get a drink at their spring not but 200 feet from the Inn.  William led Billy into the woods at the back of a rocky bluff to the spring (still there today).  As Billy bent down to take a drink, his father hit him in the back of the head with an axe, killing him.  He and his wife burried Billy that evening.  

The next morning, Billy&apos;s friend came to the Potts Inn to inquire about Billy.  The Potts acted like they didn&apos;t know what he was talking about.  Finally, after telling the entire story, William and his wife went back to the grave and dug the body back up.  Williams mother remembered a scar and birthmark that Billy had on his back, and sure enough the same marks were on this victims body, in the exact spots.

Cache ID: GC1MWR9
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D3.0/T3.5
DESC: This cache is placed not far off the river to river trail.  This trail starts on the Ohio and travels throughout Southern Illinois to end at the Mississippi.  The length of the trail is over 160 miles from end to end.  The portion of trail here follows Rock Creek.  It will take a good hour to hike to the cache, so plan to spend some time here...and may want extra batteries as well!
This area of Hardin County is known as Rock Creek.  Please park near the coordinates N 37 32.217  W 088 13.930 at the Rock Creek General Baptist Church.  Take note of the nice bridge and H shaped tree next to it.  The trail head starts up the road to the north.

An interesting story developed many years ago in the Rock Creek Community.  A plague known as the milk sickness was sweeping through the area in the mid 1800s killing many.  Local resident Anna Bixby spoke with a Shawnee Indian woman still living in the hills and determined the sickness was caused by a type of plant that the livestock was eating.  To make a long story short, all of this type of plant was exterminated and Bixby became known as a great doctor.  Now for the interesting part.  

Late one night during a terrible thunderstorm, a rider came to the Bixby household. He called out to the house that someone needed Anna?s medical skills and of course, she immediately came out. She mounted the rider?s second horse and they rode into the woods. The trail was shrouded in darkness, thanks to the heavy storm clouds overhead, and Anna soon became disoriented and unsure of their route. However, at one point during the ride, she looked over and when a flash of lighting illuminated the night, Anna saw the identity of the mysterious rider -- it was her husband Eson.

When he realized that she had discovered his identity, Bixby brought the horses to a halt and he quickly bound her hands and gagged her. It was obvious that he intended to do away with her and Anna began to panic. When she heard the jingle of chains being removed from his saddlebags, Anna became so frightened that she began to run, dashing into the dark woods. As she plunged into the forest, her fear became even stronger as she realized that she had no idea where she was. The storm continued to rage, sending rain lashing down on her and causing the wind to whip through the trees in a wild fury. Anna ran for some distance and then suddenly, the ground beneath her vanished and she tumbled over a large bluff and crashed to the ground far below. The fall broke the ropes that bound her hands but also broke some of her bones, seriously injuring her. Nevertheless, she managed to crawl a short distance to a fallen tree and slithered in behind it.

A few moments later, a light appeared in the darkness at the top of the bluff and Eson Bixby came into view carrying a burning torch. He climbed down from the top of the rocks and searched around for Anna, but he did not find her. After a few minutes, he returned to his horse and rode away. 

Once he was gone, Anna began crawling and stumbling out of the forest. It took her until sunrise to find a nearby farmhouse but when she reached it, she found herself at the doorstep of friends -- only a few houses away from her own. They quickly took her in and she told them the story of what had happened.
Bixby was soon arrested and taken to the jail in Elizabethtown. He escaped though and vanished for a time. He was later captured again in Missouri, but once again, he escaped. This time, he disappeared for good and was never seen again.

Anna lived on in the Rock Creek community of Hardin County until the 1870?s and when she died, she was buried next to her first husband and only a simple ?A? was inscribed on her tombstone. But there are those who believe that Anna, or at least her spirit, lives on.

The legend of Anna Bixby states that her husband wanted to do away with her because of a fortune that she had managed to collect over the years. What may have amounted to a ?fortune? in that day and time may have been much smaller than what we would consider to be one today but most believe that it was a large amount of money. The legend further states that when Anna learned of Eson?s greed, she hid the money away somewhere, just before he attempted to do away with her. It is believed that the hiding place for the treasure was the cave beside Rock Creek in Hooven Hollow, which was also said to have been the hiding place of an outlaw gang. 

The cave is still known as Anna Bixby Cave today and it is along the bluff, in the vicinity of the cave, where people have reported seeing a strange light appear over the years. The large, glowing light moves in and out of the trees and among the rocks, vanishing and then re-appearing without explanation. It is believed that the light may be that of Anna Bixby, still watching over the treasure that she hid away her years ago.

2009-03-06 dacjohns, Thank you again Sam for another First to Find.  This cache is in a really nice area.  We parked southeast of the cache and went cross country trying to follow an old trail.  Found the cache with no problems even though my GPSR was reading 35 feet from the cache.  We hiked out the River to River Trail to the east then followed it south back to the main road which we followed back to the car.  Trip took about 1 hour and was about 1.4 miles which included exploring some old home sites.  We probably missed a really nice section of trail where the River to River follows Rock Creek.

A little history of the building.

The Coca-Cola Bottling Company was established in Paducah by Luther and John Carson, natives of Caldwell County, who came to Paducah in 1903.  With a plant located on S. 6th st, the Carson brothers became successful regional distributors of Coca-Cola.  When the 1937 flood substantially damaged the Sixth Street operation, Luther Carson selected the cornor of Broadway and LaBelle streets (a good way from the river) as the site for a new building.
The new Coca-Cola building was construted between 1937 and 1939 in the former Wallace Park suburb, an elevated section of town that had become popular for commercial and residential development as a result of Paducah&apos;s increasingly destructive early 20th century floods.
This information came from &quot;Historic Architecture of Paducah and McCracken County Second Edition&quot; written by Steve G. Gabany,  
I recomend this book to anyone interested in the history of Paducah and it&apos;s wonderfull buildings of the past.  You can buy it at &quot;The Egg &amp; I&quot; which is located in the Arts District of downtown Paducah.

The Feed Mill Restaurant and Bar was originally a concrete block building used for storage of feed, seed corn and fertilizer by the Purina Feed Mill. It had a loft and a large dirt floor area in which the feed trucks were parked.  The building sits on part of the grain farm facing US Highway 60 in a rural setting.  Cyprus and poplar lumber from local barns were used in constructing the restaurant.

DESC: A four-stage multicache located at the New Hopewell Church cemetery with a First to Find Prize.  The race is on!  Congratulations to the ReedKyCacheFinders for the FTF!
The first stage of this cache is virtual.  The coordinates above will place you near some headstones.  Look for the 21 year old Pullam.  Subract 1833 from the year of his death to get AB  (Year of Death - 1833 = AB)
Using AB, the coordinates to the second stage are as follows:
N 37* 26.A15  W 087* 51.B53.
The second, third, and final stages of the cache are physical containers, each containing the coordinates to the next stage in the logbook.  Please be curteous in the cemetery, especially if the church is having a service at the time of your visit.  You do not have to leave the cemetery to find any part of this cache.  No cache will require you to move, tangle with, or even touch a headstone.  No special tools are required to find the cache.

This is a WCCDI Project cache.

Hidden with permision of church.

This park is known to very few.  Some people come to walk, some come to eat lunch, some come to reflect and relax.  This is another example of green space in a city.

The location has the best view in the entire park. The cache is a magnetic hide-a-key container laying flat.  It contains a log only, so BYOP. 

Beware, muggles can be all about especially at lunch time.  So, please replace as found to keep it out of their hands.

The park closes at 11:00 pm. Fishing and swimming  are not allowed.

Cache ID: GC1NB3F
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T1.5
DESC: The terrain is flat but there may be obtacles preventing wheelchair access.  The difficulty level is 2 due to the high traffic area and the need for stealth.
This cache is dedicated to all the people that strive to incease awareness of bicycle safety and the rights of bicyclists.  Some of the goals of the Share the Road program are:
?	Educate motorists and cyclists alike about laws and regulations regarding riding on roads. 
?	Improve the safety and proper use of existing bike lanes and help develop more bike lanes.  
?	Encourage legislation increasing awareness and safety regarding cycling on streets. 
Sharing The Road:
?	Bicyclists have the same rights and responsibilities on the streets that drivers do, and in most cases, they must share the lane. 
?	Bicycles are required to travel on the right hand side of the road with other traffic. Bicyclists are not allowed to travel facing traffic, since this is far less safe. 
?	They must ride as near to the right hand side of the road as practical, while avoiding road hazards that could cause them to swerve into traffic. 
?	When you?re sharing the road with bicycles, you should always expect the rider to make sudden moves. Trash, minor oil slicks, a pothole or crack in the concrete, a barking dog, a parked car or a car door opening, and other surprises can force a bicycle rider to swerve suddenly in front of you. 
?	If possible, give the cyclist the entire lane. When road conditions prevent this, pass the cyclist with extreme caution. 
?	Cyclists who are not on the extreme right hand side of the lane are not being careless, but are in fact attempting to account for traffic conditions and/or preparing to make a left turn. 
?	Oncoming bicycle traffic is often overlooked or its speed misjudged. 
The cache is a camo covered carabiner approximately two inches long.  One end screws off exposing the log compartment.  Be sure to bring your own pen.  The cache has been placed with the permission of the owners of the property.  Martha and Hutch are avid cyclists and are considering adding geocaching to their bicycling adventures.  Please park in the parking area in front of the establishment.  As always, please be stealthy.  This is a high traffic area during business hours.  Don?t hesitate to share your geocaching stories with Martha and Hutch.
Hint: This is too easy for a hint

Congrats usmcman1 for being the FTF on 11 March 2009.
Fourth in a series of Flash Caches, this is a series of multiple waypoints that will take you to some of the restaurants along the Flashes&apos; name-sake road. Each of which provides a clue for the final cache?s position. Visit each of the restaurants and write down the number from the clue provided for the restaurant. Use the number indicated to complete the cache&apos;s final location.

The given coordinates will take you to the location of the first clue.  Decipher each clue for the next location and so on.

Clue #1 - Dave&apos;s red-hair girl - C = half the # of girls on the sign out front.
Clue #2 - Not exactly underground transportation - A = # of windows beside the front doors
Clue #3 - Not a softee - B = # of stars on the roof cubed
Clue #4 - Original or Crispy - E = # of colonels on the bucket
Clue #5 - Golden supports - D = # of supports on the arches
Clue #6 - Speed of sound - F = second and fourth # on the west side of the sign in front 

The final cache coordinate is N 37 02.ABC, W 088 39.DEF

You are looking for a small lock-n-lock box with a log book and room for a few small items. Be really STEALTHY...muggles all about.

2009-06-17 regnad, Cyclonic contacted me and asked if I would be interested in going on a caching run on his day off.  Having spent the last few weeks working on remodeling our first house, I was more than eager to take a day off and get some caching under my belt.  After discussing different areas to hit, we settled on heading toward Paducah since there were several new caches that we both needed to hit.

How many times do you have to drive around in circles before you realize that perhaps you made a mistake?  For us, it was at least three or four times.  We made our pass through Lone Oak gathering the required information and then stopped to get a bite to eat.  Since we couldn&apos;t agree on the answer to one of the questions, we had two possible locations to search.  After checking both of them out (several times), we decided that we needed to go back and double check our answers.  We realized that we had missed a small detail which changed the answer to one of the hints.  This, in turn, gave us two new possible locations to search.  Looking at the map and considering the hint, we decided that one seemed better than the other, so off we went.  However, even though everything seemed to fit, we just couldn&apos;t seem to find the cache.  As a last resort, we decided to head toward the other location.  As we were pulling in, we both started laughing because we has just had lunch at this very location.  In fact, I think we parked less than 75 feet from the final hiding spot.  TFTC

2009-06-17 CyclonicKWF, When I teach in the summer I usually have Wednesday&apos;s off.  Seeing that the temperature was going to be so high today I decided a trip geocaching in a city might make more sense than trying to hit a little white ball outside for several hours.  I contacted Regnad to see if he was interested in making a caching run.  He liked the idea of taking a day away from renovating his new house.  We decided to head to Paducah since there were numerous new caches that we both needed to get.

This one gave us fits.   After getting what we thought was the correct information, we stopped at a restaurant near several of the others to grab a bite to eat.  Afterwards we headed to 2 of the possible locations (we could not agree on the correct answer to the Arch hint).  After searching both locations we realized something was not right, so we proceeded to check the hints again.  In the process we also stopped and picked up another nearby cache.  Then we finally realized we had missed one key detail about one of the hints.  Now we had two new locations.  Judging by the hint we proceeded to the one that seemed to be the most logical choice.  It put us in an area that matched the hint, but we did not feel right in searching the location.  

Finally we decided to check the other location.  Upon arriving we parked in the shade.  We walked to the location;  Regnad looked in the obvious spot and there was the cache.  We just started laughing because we had already been at this location earlier in the day after we had what we thought were the correct answers to the hints.  We could not believe it.  We signed the log, replaced the cache, and headed on our way.

Thanks for the unique cache and our tour of Lone Oak!  [:)]

DESC: Third in a series of &quot;Flash Caches&quot; placed for the LOHS Geocachers. This cache is placed for the FLASHES that move on to higher learning.
The cache CANNOT be found at the coordinates given.  

Many LOHS Flashes move on after graduating.  Some start a career. Some go away to a university or college. But many attend the local center for higher education...WKCTC. 

To locate the cache, one must find &quot;Flash Cache&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Graveyard! Micro-Flash&quot;.  On the back of each logbook you can find one part of the coordinates to the final cache.  

Cache is a small lock-n-lock box painted black. Original contents include a log-book, a pencil, and a TB. And remember what your teachers always said, &quot;Come prepared for class&quot; - BYOP.

[For those that have already found either cache, e-mail me and I will supply the hidden coordinate(s).]

DESC: Fifth in a series of Flash Caches, that celebrates the history of the Flashes&apos; name-sake town.  You will use a historical marker to open the lock on the cache.  Both are easily accessible to all. Parking is at the marker.  Be very careful, the marker is near the intersection of two busy roads.

Congrats to  jungleboy213 for being FTF on 13 March 2009.
There are two stories that  describe how the town of Lone Oak was formed.  

The first, as told by Mrs.Elizabeth McCarty in 1975, states that James Potter and George Rogers established a homestead in the 1830&apos;s between what is now Clinton and Lovelaceville roads. They were given slaves in exchange for building a dirt road to help society.

The second, and more widely accepted, states that Doctor W.T. Pepper, in 1875, bought 100 acres lying south of the city of Paducah because, &quot;It was high, beyond the reach of the rivers. A good dirt road (possibly the Potter road) ran to it from Paducah&quot;. He built a grist mill that became the center of activity between the communities of St. John&apos;s, Fremont, Oaks Station, Florence Station, and Harmoney for they were too far from Paducah back in that day.  The mill stood at intersection of U.S. 45 and Lovelaceville Road.  From here, a toll road to Paducah was established in 1887. 

In 1899, D.M. (Doc) Potts, owner of the first store in Pepper&apos;s Mill, applied for a post office.  That name could not be used, so a post office was approved for &quot;Lone Oak,&quot; hastily named for a massive stubby landmark not far from the mill site.  

What happen to the LONE OAK? It was not a FLASH of lightning. Three years later as the story goes:  &quot;Playful young men made a Christmas Night bonfire using the tree for the consummation of the fire.&quot;  

As the community grew, Pepper School, the forerunner of the schools that now serve Lone Oak, was built not far from the site of the mill in the area known as the Cambridge subdivision. It as well as Lone Oak Baptist, Lone Oak Methodist, and the Highland Cumberland Presbyterian churches, became the center of the crossroad life: pie suppers, spelling bees, and other gatherings.   

In 1888,  Professor Joe Ragsdale founded the &quot;college&quot; of Kentucky Western School, one of the first schools beyond eighth grade.  It has two stories and its outside basketball court is now covered by the Lone Oak High School gym.  

Lone Oak almost became the site of the first McCracken County High School in 1910, but that honor, as well as the honor of having the future consolidated school, went to Heath.  In 1919, Lone Oak High School succeeded Kentucky Western School.  It continued in the old college building until it burned down in  the mid-1920&apos;s. On December 26, 1971 and Feburary 2, 1972, LOHS was again destroyed by fire.  Despite these events, the Lone Oak schools have the distinction of serving more students in McCracken county than any other school community.

After the flood of 1937 devastated Paducah, many Paducah residents were attracted to the high ground of Lone Oak. This influx of citizens led to the establishment of a water system, a volunteer fire department, a public park, a civic center building, and other improvements.  U.S. 45, from Lone Oak to Paducah, was the first paved road (1921) and the first truly four-laned road (1960s) in McCracken County.  

The tiny community of Lone Oak was incorporated as a city in 1979 and then dissolved in 2008. Lone Oak High School, first established in 1919, is due to consolidate with the county&apos;s other two high schools in 2012. However, the community of Lone Oak will continue to exist. 


Use the historical marker title &quot;The Lone Oak&quot; and one of the four-digit dates to determine the combination of the lock on the cache.  The cache is a gray metal box near the historical marker.  Please re-lock the box and reset the combination so the cache will not be muggled.


Thanks to Durbin Service Station and the Lone Oak Lions Club.

I placed this cache for Louise Calhoon, known by her friends as
Weez! Weez is my wife&apos;s sister. I would have said she is my
sister-n-law but that sounds negative. Everyone&apos;s friend would fit
her to a &quot;T&quot;. So why dedicate a cache to her. Well in October of
2007 she was diagnosed with cancer. She put up a great fight but
lost the bout November 22, 2008. Everyone that knew her misses her.




She sang the loudest while caroling, the loudest parent at the
ball games, laughed the most, and had the biggest smile. We will
never forget the laughs we all had reading her poems, songs, and
letters. Even with out this cache she would not be forgotten Her
cache is more to spread who she was to even more people. When you
find the container you will see.
As for the container, it is locked to a few small trees but not
locked shut. When you find it remove all of the cover and slide the
cable up the trees to stand it up. PLEASE REMEMBER TO REHIDE IT AS
WELL OR BETTER THAN YOU FOUND IT. The size of the container makes
it hard to hide.

Take the kids! They will love the container and swag, not to
mention the playground of sorts near the cache at N 36* 45.356 W
088* 39.277. Don&apos;t forget the pictures!

2009-11-21 msptcowboy, We found this one after some tracking through the woods. Went one way and came out another.
Forgot that I am 62 now and climbing and fences aren&apos;t quite as easy as they were when I was
younger but I took my shoe off, got a toe hold and over the fence I went. Got to start taking my
camera, the find and the fence climbing would made for a good laugh. We took nothing, just signed
the log.

Martin Luther King, Jr., (January 15, 1929-April 4, 1968) was born Michael Luther King, Jr., but later had his name changed to Martin. His grandfather began the family&apos;s long tenure as pastors of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to 1931;  his father has served from then until the present, and from 1960 until his death Martin Luther acted as co-pastor. Martin Luther attended segregated public schools in Georgia, graduating from high school at the age of fifteen;  he received the B. A. degree in 1948 from Morehouse College, a distinguished Negro institution of Atlanta from which both his father and grandfather had graduated. After three years of theological study at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania where he was elected president of a predominantly white senior class, he was awarded the B.D. in 1951. With a fellowship won at Crozer, he enrolled in graduate studies at Boston University, completing his residence for the doctorate in 1953 and receiving the degree in 1955. In Boston he met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman of uncommon intellectual and artistic attainments. Two sons and two daughters were born into the family.

You are looking for a camo-covered film canister located just outside Mainstreet Shoppes in Clay.  The cache should be relatively easy to find.  Although there are several power lines that run over the location that could mess with your reception, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll have any trouble locating the cache, given its name.

I chose this location because it is a favorite spot of mine to stop for ice cream and I thought others might enjoy it, too.

Found it
2009-09-04 CyclonicKWF, After teaching today, I thought I would take advantage of what started out as a beautiful day to do some caching.  Since Regnad was busy with meetings I decided to go to Mayfield seeing how it is so close and there were several caches there I needed to find.  

I have driven by the cemetery several times mostly   It always seemed a little out of place since Mayfield has slowly grown up around it.  I made this one a little harder than it was since I went to the location I thought it would be at and not the location my GPS said it was.  Finally I looked at my GPS and discovered the cache.  Interesting hide.  I signed the log, replaced the cont, and headed on to the next cache.

After visiting the Highland Park Cemetery Cache, I drove over to this cemetery.  This has always been an interesting looking cemetery being on the hill.  It took me awhile to find this cache since it was very well hidden.  It also would have helped for me to have payed attention to the cache page saying the cache was like one you saw in PA.  Then I would have know the size and type of container.  Unlike the Caution cache I found earlier the log in this cache was a little damp.  I don&apos;t know if had not gotten shut properly or if there is a slight leak.  Signed the log and headed on my way.  

After visiting this cache I stopped at the nearby Catholic Cemetery to pay my respects to a MSU student who died in a car wreck 9 years ago.  Then I stopped at the new park to see how the new disc golf course had progressed. 

Thanks for the cache and the chance to visit this area again.

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.0/T2.0
DESC: Located a short walk down an ATV path.  There may be some mud for several days after a rain.  Watch for snakes due to it&apos;s close proximity to water and the fact that it is in the woods.
The cache is a container about the size of a gallon jug with a large screw off lid that has been painted camo.  I named this cache &quot;Fishin Buddy&quot;  because I first came to this lake with a buddy of mine to go fishin several years ago.  The original contents of the cache are: Log Book, Pen, Hella Decal, fishing lure(in the box), stringer, bobber, green turtle, signature card, and &quot;Ringer&quot; Travel Bug.
Hint: Face the lake and look for a large hollow based tree.

DESC: The cache is located near a historical marker.  There is a short pull off area available for viewing the marker.
The Jackson Purchase is an 8500 square mile tract of land formerly tribal land of the Chickasaw Indians.  The United States paid $300,000.00 for the tract in 1818 after negotiations by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby.  The tract is bordered by the Tennessee, Ohio and Mississippi rivers. 
The road near the cache is narrow.  Traffic is heavy at times.  Caution should be taken due to the narrow road and traffic.  The cache is a small pill bottle covered in black camo tape.

2009-11-20 Lego Crew, This was the first cache of a LONG day of driving.  For some reason, thought we were still in Illinois when we found this one, but only realized we had crossed into Kentucky as we were logging it.  A relatively quick find between breaks in the passing traffic.  Had to grab my log extraction tool for this one.  Thanks!

Cache ID: GC1PG2J
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: This cache is located on the LOWER PART OF THE BLUFF. It&apos;s placed by a little trail that runs parallel to the main trail. It&apos;s a nice area, where you can find little caves on the bluff. As usual, watch for ticks and snakes.
This cache is a small lock n&apos; lock, transparent, with a log book and few small items, and for the first to find, we placed on it two arrowheds (hence the name of the cache) that were found in the area immediately east of Little Grand Canyon, and that were made by the native habitants of Southern Illinois, as described on this excerpt below:

  &quot;At the dawn of the historic era, when European explorers first entered the land¬¬ we now call the State of Illinois, they encountered a people who became known to the world as the Illinois or Illiniwek Indians. The Illinois were a populous and powerful nation that occupied a large section of the Mississippi River valley. They became important allies of French fur traders and colonists who came to live among them, and they played a key role in the early history of what would later become the midwestern United States.

The story of the Illinois people is a remarkable tale of adaptation and change. Their world was turned upside down during their long association with French settlers and, later, British and American colonists. As time passed, their population declined and many of their traditional ways of life changed as they adapted to new situations. Eventually the Illinois were forced to leave their traditional lands and move west to Indian Territory. Their descendants, the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, are now scattered throughout the United States but maintain their tribal headquarters in Miami, Oklahoma.

This is the story of the Illinois people when they lived in their traditional homeland, a place the French used to call the &quot;Illinois Country.&quot; The story is based, in part, on historical descriptions of the Illinois by French observers like Jacques Marquette and Pierre Delliette, who traveled or lived among them three-hundred years ago. Another part of the story comes from archaeology, as several of the village sites occupied historically by the Illinois people have been excavated by archaeologists. Information also comes from the descendants of the Illinois themselves, who have shared some of their traditional folk tales and have compiled photographs and other documents relating to their history.

Illinois technology included a wide variety of objects that had value in the economic, social, and belief systems of the society. Most of these objects were obtained by the Illinois from their natural environment and fashioned into such things as dwellings, tools, or weapons. Other objects were obtained from trading partners in other societies, including members of neighboring Indian tribes and, historically, French traders who sought hides and furs produced by the Illinois. French trade goods had already reached the Illinois when Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet became the first European explorers to enter the Illinois Country in 1673. During the following century, many items of traditional Illinois technology were replaced with European objects as the Illinois adapted to their coexistence with French missionaries and settlers.&quot; (Source: http://tiny.cc/arrowhead)

2009-04-05 photohiker13, FTF!  9:31 am. Saw this one pop up a couple of days ago and with yesterday&apos;s super nice weather I thought for sure someone would go for it.  This morning though I checked on-line and still no one had logged it.  It was my chance, so we left early. Today the weatherman was calling for thunderstorms so I had to time it just right, because this is not a place you want to be when it rains.  I have hiked this area for 10 years and I knew several options out if it did rain that would not evolve going up either canyon.

We headed down the first canyon and water was still running from Thursday&apos;s rain, but small dry patches were, also, there.  We navigated down and arrived in a wildflower haven.  I thought I had seen this area in its many moods, but I was not prepared for this.  It seemed every wildflower in the Shawnee Hills were here,  Virigina Bluebells, wood poppies, trilliums, toadshades, wild oats, False solomon&apos;s seal, dutcheman breeches and one I have seen only at Rim Rock, squirrel corn.  

In the canyon our GPSr&apos;s went crazy.  My Delorme PN-40 could only get an estimated accuracy of 120 feet.  Arrghh!!  So we relied on the description.  Couldn&apos;t find the trail to right, but soon found out that tregiani had come from the opposite direction making it my left.  Did not want to disturb this beautiful ecological area, I limited my search to places were I would not step on any wildflowers.  This is there home and I&apos;m only a visitor.  I hugged the bluff and walked right by it, but on my back my geo-senses took over and I found it.  Hooray!!  We took nothing and I left this places big brother (Grand Canyon) keychain.

We decided since the clouds were not threating, to hike the entire loop.  When we got near the canyon going out, it started to rain.  It made the rocks a little slicker, but we were in no danger.  Took some pics of Swallow Rock and then enjoyed the hike back to the vechile.  Thanks for bringing back to a place I love!

DESC: This is a cache in the Mcracken County Cemetery Series that will highlight the many cemeteries located through out McCracken County.

Congrats to  tubaman67 and tubadude92 for being FTF on 3 April 2009.
Next to the larger Mt Kenton Cemetery, the Temple of Israel has a low wrought iron fence and gate surrounding the Jewish cemetery. The number of large markers and mausoleums near the front fence also can distinguish the cemetery from Mt. Kenton. Graves are placed together rather closely, especially in comparison to those in Mt. Kenton. The cemetery is very well maintained. Because of the size and variety of markers, it gives one the impression of an ideal old country cemetery. Although some burials occurred during the Civil War era, most of the older markers date from the 1870s and 1880s. A number of these also have partial inscription in German, Hebrew, or Yiddish. Even on the older stones, Jewish symbols are rare. Victorian symbols and art such as sleeping lambs are common. The earlier stones often list the birthplace of immigrants such as the southern German towns of Hechingen and Hohenzollern. Place of death is also listed on a number of markers, recording that Jewish settlers from other towns in southern Illinois and western Kentucky were buried in Temple Israel Cemetery. 

Many of these early markers are in good condition;  few inscriptions are rather faint. Most graves seem to be arranged in family plots, although there are a number of single burials. Around 1900, a number of families set up large mausoleums while others began to use a standardized flat-to-the-ground slab as marker. These slabs were rather plain and never display Jewish symbols, Hebrew letters, or any information beyond names and dates. More recent stones are typical contemporary Jewish headstones - some Hebrew and symbols. 

You are looking for a black canister with a chrome cap. It contains a log only. You do not need to enter the cemetery to find the cache.

Some argue as to whether this should be allowed or not, but I am in agreement with allowing caches to be hidden in or near a cemetery. A lot of times these places and the people who are residents thereof seem to be forgotten. In order not to forget, this series is in conjunction with the KY Tombstone Transcription Project. Besides just signing a log, contribute by uploading a picture of a headstone and a transcription of the headstone&apos;s information not already provided.

Please be very respectful. No graves need to be disturbed. Closely abide by cemetery rules. All cemeteries are closed after dusk.

If a geocacher knows of a cemetery that is not apart of this series, feel free to contribute a cache. However, please obtain permission of the land owner or care-taker first.

Cache ID: GC1PPMN

SIZE: Not chosen
D1.0/T3.0
DESC: Mantle Rock is located in Livingston County, KY.  This natural arch is the center pieces of the preserve owned by the Nature Conservancy.  This area is not only replete with biological diversity, but with historical &amp; archaeological significance as well.
WEATHERING AGENTS
No matter the type of arch found in Kentucky, each are shaped by the process of weathering. Weathering can be thought of as the destruction of the rock. The primary agent is water, which seeps into cracks and dissolves the iron oxide in the sandstone and the calcium carbonate in limestone. Iron oxide acts to hold or c&quot;ement&quot; the adjorning rock togeter and its removal results in this breakdown. Similar to water, plant roots find their way into crevices and split the rock. The wind works to remove the broken rock from the area.

LIGHTHOUSE ARCHES
Also known as ridge top arches or rock shelter arches, the vast majority of the arches in Kentucky are known as lighthouse arches which form at the ridgetop meeting of two valleys. A lighthouse arch is formed in the following manner:

1) The ridgetop is weathered over time. 
2) Vertical cracks are created by the freezing and thawing of water in the formation. 
3) Water runs into these cracks and erodes away the sides of the ridgetops. leaving a narrow ridge. 
4) The newly exposed and softer sandstone is weathered away, forming rock shelters on both sides of the ridge. 
6) Erosion continues within the areas of the rocks shelters until both meet, forming the arch.

Numerous bluffs, shelters, and honeycomb formations embellish this area, which is also known for its extensive faulting and abundant fluorite deposits.

BIODIVERSITY
Visitors will find a visit in any season to be a rewarding experience. Rich wildflowers carpet the cliffs in springtime;  a small babbling stream adds to the tranquility. Fragile sandstone glades are interspersed throughout the upland forest community. These areas are some of the best examples in Kentucky of this rare community type.
Kentucky&apos;s only known occurrence of June grass (Koeleria cristata) thrives here along with other characteristic glade species such as: prickly pear cactus (Opuntia humifusa), rush foil (Crotonopsis elliptica), hairy lipfern (Cheilanthes lanosa), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), pinweed (Lechea tenufolia), poverty grass (Danthonia spicata).  Scattered deep soil pockets are dominated by: gnarled and stunted post oak (Quercus stellata), Blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), and red cedar (Juniperus virginiana).
Forest and grassland wildlife species are plentiful at Mantle Rock. These include: grassland and forest guilds of songbirds, deer, turkey, and squirrels.

ARCHEOLOGICAL HISTORY
During the harsh winter of 1838-39, many Cherokee Native Americans being expelled along the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; were delayed by treacherous river conditions on the Ohio. They sought shelter under Mantle Rock and other nearby rock shelters.


From Salem, KY (US 60), take Hwy 133 north two miles past Joy. On the south side of Hwy 133 is the historical plaque marking the entrance.

2009-05-10 regnad, Since it was Mother&apos;s day, Ethan and I asked Darua what she wanted to do.  She suggested we come up here and explore around Mantle Rock since she missed out on the RVG outing a few weeks ago.  Not wanting to miss a chance to grab a fairly new cache, I jumped at the opportunity.  We had alot of fun climbing around on the rocks, exploring both the bluff and surrounding area.  We didn&apos;t get a chance to see the Indian Rock art that Joe recently found, but I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be back up here sometime in the future.  TFTC
Found it
2009-04-11 GEO.JOE, We where just at Mantle Rock Last week with some folks from RVG but I was not able to hunt for the Native American Rock Art near there so we were already planning on going back and today was a perfect day. The Weather was great, we got the FTF and we found the rock art on the east side of Flat Rock. I did  not get the exact coordinates and my Track Log was really broken up the rock are in in the large shelter on a flat topped boulder on the floor of the shelter near. N37 21.235 W88 25.746.
We then went south along the bluff until we found a way to the top of the bluff. We then found a great boulder on the edge of the bluff to sit and look out over the valley and listen to the creek at N37 21.238 W88 25.852. 
There are a lot of trees and limbs down in the area so it makes walking tough. The trail down to Mantle Rock is clear but the rest of the trails in the valley and on top of Mantle Rock are covered in downed trees and limbs so it makes getting around tough.

This is an interesting area.  What used to be there?  I began looking in the wrong area, but quickly find the cache when I went to the right area.  The added piece to the container might need to be fixed since it was loose.  I signed the log and tried to replace the cache the best I could.  Then it was off to the next cache.

                                 HISTORY

The Freight House was built in 1925 by the Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railway The portion of the NC &amp; St L, which runs from Bruceton, Tennessee to Paducah, was originally the Paducah, Tennessee, and Alabama Railway In 1895, the PT &amp; A was acquired by the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railway, and in 1895 was leased by the L &amp; N back to its subsidiary, the NC &amp; St L
In 1917 the NC &amp; St L Railway and the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railway jointly constructed a rail line and a double track bridge between Paducah and Metropolis. The bridge (which is listed by the Encyclopedia Britannica as the world?s longest simple truss bridge) made a gateway connection between the NC &amp; St L in the south and the CB &amp; Q or Burlington Route for the north and west. Later;  the Illinois Central bought a third interest, in the bridge and is now the primary user (as of May 1996).
While the freight house was built in 1925, plans were being made to extend this connection to include links with the Big Four, (part of the New York Central System) and other railroads. As a result, the Paducah freight house was constructed to handle a large volume of business and included a Division Superintendent?s Office on the second floor in addition to the local freight office and warehouse on the first floor.
For various reasons those other links were never consummated. However a large amount of freight business was done between the CB &amp; Q and the NC &amp; St L and for a number of years, ending in 1936, the Gulf, Mobile &amp; Northern also ran into Paducah over NC &amp; St L rails. Also until 1951, NC &amp; St L passenger trains were operated between Paducah and Hollow Rock Junction (now Bruceton) Tennessee and Hickman, Kentucky.
From the 1930s through the early 1970s thousands of refrigerator car loads of fruits and vegetables from all over the nation were unloaded by brokers on the team track behind the freight house. This occurred because favorable freight rates to Paducah made it feasible for produce dealers in the states surrounding Kentucky to haul their merchandise out of Paducah on their own trucks.
In 1957 the NC &amp; St L was absorbed into its parent, the Louisville &amp; Nashville, and in 1972 the CB &amp; Q became part of the transcontinental Burlington Northern. In 1956 the L &amp; N, along with other roads, dropped its LCL. business which had been handled through the Paducah freight house. By 1974 the L &amp; N reduced its employee force in Paducah and moved the freight office to the yards at 6th and Norton.
In November 1975, the freight house and adjacent tracks were purchased by Bob and Jack Johnston and Bill Backus who had for many years operated produce and food brokerage businesses out of the building. The house siding was rebuilt and realigned to allow the placing of refrigerator cars at the unloading doors, and for several more years the building handled large amount of rail freight
On August 10, 1972 the Illinois Central Railroad merged with the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad to form the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad. In the 1980s, the railroad spun off most of its east-west lines and many of its redundant north-south lines, including much of the former GM&amp;O. Most of these lines were bought by other railroads, including entirely new railroads, such as the Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway and Chicago Central and Pacific Railroad. On February 29, 1988, the ICG dropped the &quot;Gulf&quot; from its name and again became known as the Illinois Central Railroad. 
By the middle 1980 changes in railroad policies toward perishable freight business, as well as new directions in the food distribution business, caused most produce businesses to move to large refrigerated trucks, and the warehouse was used as a cross-dock loading and distribution point for trucking produce from growing areas to wholesale customers in a four state area.
The 1990s have brought further changes. The L &amp; N (now CSX) abandoned service to Paducah in 1983, and in 1986, the Illinois Central Gulf sold its entire Kentucky Division to an entity known as the Paducah &amp; Louisville Railroad. The Burlington Northern began bringing Container and TOFC trains as well as mixed freight to Paducah for forwarding further east by Paducah &amp; Louisville.
In 1992, because of lack of business, the P &amp; L removed the lead tracks from the old L &amp; N yards at 6th and Norton St. and the building became ?land-locked?.
In 1993, after the Johnstons and Backus retired, they sold the building to Charles and Carolyn Simpson who renovated the warehouse and opened a large antique mall. Because of their interest in railroad history, the Simpsons upgraded the heating and air conditioning in a section of rooms on the second floor of the freight house and gave free use of it to the newly formed Paducah Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society to use for a railroad museum. The museum opened in April 1996.
The freight house was sold and the Museum moved to a building one-half block away, at Washington and 2nd streets. The new facility is larger and allows for a more expansive display.
The Paducah Chapter, NRHS, hopes that the museum and its collections will continue to grow and bring pleasant memories to both the older and younger generations of the railroads? rich heritage of both the Paducah area and nation.     (May 1996)

Cache ID: GC1PN7Y

SIZE: Not chosen
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: The Mississippi River is the longest river in the United States, with a length of 2,320 miles (3,730 km) from its source in Lake Itasca in Minnesota to its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Mississippi River is part of the Missouri-Mississippi river system, which is the largest river system in North America and among the largest in the world: by length (3,900 miles (6,300 km)), it is the fourth longest, and by its average discharge of 572,000 cu ft/s (16,200 m³/s), it is the tenth largest.

The widest point of the Mississippi River is Lake Winnibigoshish, near Grand Rapids, Minnesota at over 7 miles (11 km) across.The Mississippi River runs through 10 states and was used to define portions of these states&apos; borders.

The Mississippi River drains most of the area between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains, except for the areas drained to the Hudson Bay via the Red River of the North, by the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, the Rio Grande (and numerous other rivers in Texas), the Alabama River-Tombigbee River, and the Chattahoochee River-Appalachicola River.

The Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles (160 km) downstream from New Orleans. Measurements of the length of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary somewhat, but the United States Geological Survey&apos;s number is 2,340 miles (3,770 km). The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is about 90 days.

The Mississippi river discharges at an annual average rate of between 200 and 700 thousand cubic feet per second (7,000&amp;#8211; 20,000 m3/s).[10] Although it is the 5th largest river in the world by volume, this flow is a mere fraction of the output of the Amazon, which moves nearly 7 million cubic feet per second (200,000 m3/s) during wet seasons. On average the Mississippi has only 9% the flow of the Amazon River but is nearly twice that of the Columbia River and almost 6 times the volume of the Colorado River.


The Mississippi River downcut through the limestone bedrock forming the great bluffs that we now see. Across the floodplain, which is shared with the Missouri River, is another line of bluffs, also composed of limestone. The great breadth of the floodplain relative to the size of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers is due to the large volume of glacial meltwater that flowed through this river valley in the waning stages of the Ice Age. 

Draped across the top of the limestone bluffs is a blanket of wind-blown silt, called loess (pronounced &quot;luss&quot;), that is over 50 feet thick in places. In the waning days of the Ice Age, the meltwaters carried huge volumes of sediment from the melting glaciers. This sediment was deposited in the floodplain and became exposed in the winter when the meltwaters receded. Winter winds whipped up the exposed clay and silt from the floodplain and deposited them on the bluffs. 

The Mississippi River, like all rivers, is in a constant state of change. Various forms of the Mississippi River have flowed through our area for more than a million years, but the Upper Mississippi River Valley as we know it was primarily shaped during the most recent glacial stage of the Great Ice Age, The Wisconsin period.  

The Wisconsin glaciation period started about 75, 000 years ago and ended about 12,000 years ago when the North American climate began to warm. It was a world hardly recognizable today. Minnesota and Wisconsin were populated by a variety of very large animals called megafauna which lived in the cold climate on the margins of the glacial ice. Because larger animals lost body heat more slowly, bigger was indeed better. 

Giant-sized animals including mastodons, mammoths and caribou roamed this area. Because of the north-south orientation of the river, many of our ancient fishes had merely moved south as the waters grew too cold, and then expanded back into the northern portion of the river as the glaciers retreated. Ancient fish that predate the glaciers and still live in the waters of the Upper Mississippi River include long-nosed and short-nosed gar, sturgeon and paddlefish.

Hickman County, in the Mississippi Embayment region, is a gently rolling area adjacent to the Mississippi River. Upland ridges and hills rarely attain elevations of 500 feet. The highest point, 510 feet, is on the divide between Obion and Sand Creeks about 2 1/2 miles south-southeast of Fulgham.

Local reliefs are moderate, generally about 50 feet. The bluffs along the Mississippi are 100 to 200 feet in height and are the sites of the greatest local relief in the county. The bluff at Columbus-Belmont State Park rises approximately 170 feet above the river, and Chalk Bluff is almost 200 feet high.


The lowest elevation is approximately 276 feet, the point where the Mississippi River leaves the county.

In Hickman County, water is obtained from unconsolidated sediments of the Tertiary and Quaternary ages. The oldest geologic formation exposed on the surface in Hickman County is the Tertiary Claiborne Formation. The Tertiary began 70 million years ago, and deposits consisted of marine and fresh to brackish-water sediments. The distribution of deposits indicates that the area was near the northern limit of the Gulf embayment (also called Mississippi Embayment). Portions of the embayment must have been swampy because thin beds of lignite (brown coal) and carbonaceous clays occur in the western half of the eight-county Jackson Purchase area. These geological deposits are a marked contrast to the underlying older hard rocks, because most of the Cretaceous and younger sediments remain unconsolidated and soft.Over the last one million years unconsolidated Quaternary sediments have been deposited along the larger streams and rivers.

To log Earthcache answer the following questions and do the following:
1. Standing at the coordinates facing the river, what historical area is to your right and up on top of the bluff?
2. How many states are visible from where you are standing?
3. Guess how far it is to the other side of the river, directly west.
E-mail me the answers to these prior questions.
4. Take a picture of yourself in front of the guage at the posted coordinates with the guage in the background. Post picture on the log.

2009-10-16 RicknJoy, We headed out this weekend on a 700-mile trip to the Bootheel to finish up the Missouri County Challenge and the Missouri DeLorme Challenge.
We crossed the Mississippi river a few times today (including once on a ferry!), but for a moment there, Rick thought he might REALLY experience the river. While backing up to frame a picture, he suddenly realized that his feet were cold and wet, but it wasn’t the river - he was only sinking into a wet patch of loess!

2009-09-29 GEO.JOE, I have the feeling that I have been here before : )
I came up from Hickman through the bottoms and then bluff top road taking as many back roads, field roads I could take and even a place where there used to be a road but flooding dumped a lot of sand. I was glad to have 4 wheel drive and enjoyed using it : ) I was glad the old road was still on the other side of the sand and at the end of that field so I did not have to chance going back through the sand and taking a 10+ mile trip back around. Some of the sand hills were taller than my truck. ;  )
Thanks for the cache and the education on the river. There was a fire on the other side of the river that I had been been watching the column of smoke all the way north.

2009-09-04 CyclonicKWF, After teaching today, I thought I would take advantage of what started out as a beautiful day to do some caching. Since Regnad was busy with meetings I decided to go to Mayfield seeing how it is so close and there were several caches there I needed to find.

This was my first trip to the Graves County Library.  Nice looking facility.  I picked the right time to come by with it being after hours, so the place was empty.  I was able to park near the cache location.  I was a little thrown off by the hint, because I was able to get to the cache no problem.  Wow, an actually container to swap swag in Mayfield!  What a nice surprise.  I did not swap any swag.   i signed the log, replaced the cache and was on my way again.  Thanks for the cache!

There are two compartments to the container.  One is for the log and the other was added to move trackable items.
Now about this odd place...

My daughter and I went out to place this cache and she picked the location.  The location is where it all happened.  What happened you ask.  Well you will have to go and see.  I can say that my 60CSx went nuts!  I had to take cords in four locations about 10 feet away from GZ and then average it out!  So be ready for you GPSr to go nuts at the posted coords!  The good thing about it you will know you are in the right spot!  

So if you do not believe the above then maybe you will believe I just placed an easy cache whit a new spin on the usual.  

Either scenario you choose to believe I can guarantee you will find a memorable cache that I am sure you have never seen before!  So bring the camera and enjoy.

This was the first time wounding myself in the name of the hunt, I got so excited that I could put one of my freshly printed &quot;emergency&quot; log sheets in the container that I lost all situational awareness and bent over to get the log out of my bag and stuck a broken branch in my forehead (not as bad as it sounds).

2009-07-26 thesilverspyder, I think this area is just too grown up for us to find it. It looks like a death trap as far as ticks and chiggers are concerned. I would suggest moving it closer to the road or make it available to the highway closeby.

2009-06-17 regnad, Cyclonic contacted me and asked if I would be interested in going on a caching run on his day off.  Having spent the last few weeks working on remodeling our first house, I was more than eager to take a day off and get some caching under my belt.  After discussing different areas to hit, we settled on heading toward Paducah since there were several new caches that we both needed to hit.

This was our second stop of the trip and first DNF.  We weren&apos;t exactly prepared for the tall weeds but we decided to go ahead and see if we could find the cache.  However, between worrying about getting covered in ticks and getting a bad rash from the poison ivy, we ended up walking away empty handed.
Didn&apos;t find it
2009-06-17 CyclonicKWF, Regnad and I came up empty on this one.  We were not for sure if it isn&apos;t there or if it was just too overgrown for us to find.  Owner might want to verify that it is still there.

Congrats to  twistyipper for being the FTF on April 23, 2009.
Many drive to and fro down Lone Oak Road on a daily basis.  To the masses this little cemetery goes unnoticed. In 1876, Stone Square Lodge No. 5 F&amp;AM established this once larger cemetery in then-rural Lone Oak as an alternative to Paducah&apos;s Oak Grove Cemetery for African-Americans. Three large tacts were sold in the 1970&apos;s for econmic development, and are occupied by the Super Valu shopping center across the road and Plaza Tire next door.  

Most of the graves have been disinterred and relocated to other cemeteries. The last burial known to have occurred was that of Tula Miles in June 1982.  There are nineteen marked graves and three with simple cement markers:
   
Little Albert Fortson	1876               
Frankie Cills	1879               
Serida Cills	1881               
David Fortson	1881

It has been reported by the Paducah-Sun that the lodge is planning to sell the tract of land and that the graves will be moved to Paducah&apos;s Oak Grove cemetery. A monument will be placed noting the cemetery&apos;s original location.

Some argue as to whether this should be allowed or not, but I am in agreement with allowing caches to be hidden in or near a cemetery. A lot of times these places and the people who are residents thereof seem to be forgotten. In order not to forget, this series is in conjunction with the KY Tombstone Transcription Project.  Besides just signing a log, contribute by uploading a picture of a headstone and a transcription of the headstone&apos;s information not already provided.

Please be very respectful. No graves need to be disturbed. Closely abide by cemetery rules.  All cemeteries are closed after dusk.

If a geocacher knows of a cemetery that is not apart of this series, feel free to contribute a cache.  However, please obtain permission of the land owner or care-taker first.

DESC: This is a cache in the Mcracken County Cemetery Series that will highlight the many cemeteries located through out McCracken County.  You are looking for a small clear plastic tube with a silver screw cap. Its larger than a nano but smaller than a buffalo tube. It is magnetic. Contains a log only, so BYOP and tweezers. You do not need to enter the cemetery to find this cache. Please replace as found.

Congrats to  twistyipper for being the FTF on 23 April 2009.
The original tract of land that came to be Mount Kenton Cemetery was deeded by Joseph Kenton of New Orleans, Louisiana to the Church of the Old School Presbyterian on July 6, 1857. The transfer called for the land to be used to erect a church, a school or a cemetery. Eventually the trustees opted to use the land for a cemetery. 

The cemetery is located on thirty-five acres along Lone Oak Road. It is a peaceful site amid an ever-expanding urban area. Well-landscaped and maintained, Mount Kenton is the final resting place of many local, state and national political and civic figures. Vice-President Alben Barkley is buried there. 

Some argue as to whether this should be allowed or not, but I am in agreement with allowing caches to be hidden in or near a cemetery. A lot of times these places and the people who are residents thereof seem to be forgotten. In order not to forget, this series is in conjunction with the KY Tombstone Transcription Project. Besides just signing a log, contribute by uploading a picture of a headstone and a transcription of the headstone&apos;s information not already provided.

Please be very respectful. No graves need to be disturbed. Closely abide by cemetery rules. All cemeteries are closed after dusk.

If a geocacher knows of a cemetery that is not apart of this series, feel free to contribute a cache. However, please obtain permission of the land owner or care-taker first.
Hint: St. Peter will be at this.

All trails to this cache require a climb. Once on top of the
bluff, the view is breathtaking. Don&apos;t forget your
camera.
We placed this cache by riding our horses to this location in
   Shawnee
   National Forest from Bay Creek Ranch Campground. It took us
   less than an hour to get to this location from the campground.
   The cache location can also be accessed from the East Trigg
   Trailhead or the Millstone Bluff Trailhead. It appears that the
   area could also be accessed by driving north on the second road
   west of the intersection of 145 &amp;amp;  147.
   
Click here for a forestry map of the area. 
The cache container is a recycled plastic KoolAid container
covered in camouflage tape. If you stand facing the trail with your
back to the bluff (a location from which you will be unable to see
the water), the cache is on the right side of the trail.
Congratulations to catdad for being the FTF.

2009-05-07 pneuma, Hummm.  We are gonna camp at Lake Glendale the last of June and hope to do caches in the area.   Hope this one is intact as it sounds like it&apos;s scenic.  But since geojoe could not find it it makes us wonder if it&apos;s there.  Will watch for finders between now and then.   Happy caching.
Didn&apos;t find it
2009-05-02 GEO.JOE, 10 min[?] Our hats are off to Catdad. We spent about an hour and did not find the cache. It appeared that someone had been looking where we were looking because we saw disturbed leaves and some disturbed rocks but no luck. We hunted a 70 foot long strip near where the coordinates took us(about 30 min and 3 trips back and forth) so we looked at the hint. Well that described the entire area where we had been looking, so we did one more look through and then we expanded our search to where we think the cache should have been hidden (about 100 too 160 feet from the coordinates), Guess what? It wasn&apos;t there either [; )]

2009-05-02 catdad, FTF!  Getting to this cache was an adventure. After the recent rains the road to the cache site was passable only by a jeep or truck. Luckily I drive a car. (Ford Taurus)  I drug the bottom, spun in the mud, and somehow ended up less than .15 from the cache. After a short walk and a steep climb I found the area. This is one of those places that have about 100 good hide sites at ground zero. After 10 minutes I was signing the log and then explored around the lake. This is a nice lake and I will have to come back and spend more time looking around.

Thanks for placing a cache here. catdad

DESC: Located in the vicinity of Pounds Hollow Lake in Southern Illinois. The path will get you close, but some light bush wacking is required.
This cache was placed on 4/25/2009, when I became engaged to the love of my life at Pounds Hollow Lake. My fiance and I placed this cache in one of our very favorite spots to get away when we were attending Murray State University. The original contents of this cache tell a small story about us. Hope you enjoy!

Brian hid the cache on Monday, and took Sarah out to Pounds Hollow on Saturday. After waiting for everyone else to leave, we decided to do a little geocaching. After about 10 minutes, Sarah found the cache. Brian made her take it back to the lake, and when she opened the cache the note inside said:

&quot;In order to complete this cache, turn around and answer the question that is asked&quot;

Sarah turned around to see Brian on one knee with a beautiful ring. She said yes!! After watching the stars for a bit, we hiked out and stayed the night at the River Rose Inn, a beautiful bed and breakfast in Elizabethtown, Il.


Original cache contents:

Airplane - Brian is a pilot, and applying to the United States Coast Guard for aviation

Purple Crayola Marker - Sarah&apos;s favorite color is purple. She also has a degree in interior design, and loves to color!

Frog stickers - Sarah loves frogs!

Carabiner - We love to rock climb!

Thunderstorm Sticker - storms rock!

Map of Land Between the Lakes - if you have never been - go. Absolutely beautiful and lots to do!!

Southern Illinois Wine Trail brochure - some of our very favorite wineries! Lots of fun!

Murray State University decoration - We graduated! Woo hoo!




If you take a trinket, please leave a trinket. Happy caching!

As it turned out, we parked only about 400 feet from this one by accident.  Had the coords for the other cache loaded then noticed we were closer to this one first.  CONGRATS!!! on both the engagement and your graduation.  This is a really nice place.  The Shawnee National Forest was our destination for our little trip to this was out first stop there.  Fall colors starting to pop but will be REALLY nice in another week or so I&apos;ll bet.  THIS CACHE WILL NEED SOME MAINTENANCE!!!

2009-05-25 Nodrog2, Caching with Pegleg.  Given a previous log and our experience, I think the published coordinates may be a bit off.  We each had a receiver and they agreed closely.  If you can&apos;t find the cache at the given coords, look about 78 feet southeast.  That&apos;s where we found it.  TNLN.  TFTC.  Oh yes, the park is still closed except for foot traffic so we walked the roads in.

2009-05-10 SidewaysSam, Great story to this one!  My fiance and I were at the lake the day after your engagement...we hiked a trail from the rim rock trail to the lake.  It was a clean open trail that was relatively short and very scenic.  Since the Pounds campground roads are closed, it would probably be just as quick and more scenic to start at rimrock (go down the stairs at the cliffs) and hike to the lake.  Hope to get this cache soon!  Best of luck with the plans!
Found it
2009-05-03 dacjohns, Now I know why you hiked out.  Pounds Hollow is still closed.

We hiked through the green tunnel in a light rain.  The forest smelled really good.  We eventually found the cache, I was hoping it wasn&apos;t where my receiver was indicating and luckily it wasn&apos;t.  My receiver was showing the cache about 90 feet from where we found it.  

For those of you not familiar with the Shawnee National Forest there is poison ivy here.  It is best to stay on the trails/roads as much as possible and not get off when you don&apos;t have to.

We left you some &quot;Hotwheels&quot; for your honeymoon.  A red 2009 Corvette.

Thanks for the cache and congratulations.

Albert Benjamin &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler, Sr. (July 14, 1898 ? June 15,
1991) was twice governor of Kentucky, a U.S. Senator, the 2nd
Commissioner of Major League Baseball, and a member of the Baseball
Hall of Fame. His jovial attitude earned him the nickname &quot;Happy,&quot;
which stuck for the remainder of his life. Chandler&apos;s first term as
governor is still regarded as one of the most productive of any
Kentucky governor. Following on this success, he unsuccessfully
tried to unseat Senate Majority Leader and fellow Kentuckian Alben
Barkley, but was appointed to the Senate shortly after the election
due to the death of the state&apos;s junior senator. He would later
resign this position to become Commissioner of Baseball, steering
it through the difficult period of integration, which many contend
led to his not being offered a second contract for the position.
Instead, twenty years after his first term as governor of Kentucky,
Chandler returned to the Governor&apos;s Mansion using the slogan &quot;Be
Like Your Pappy and Vote For Happy.&quot; Later in life, Chandler&apos;s
commitment to civil rights was questioned as he supported Dixiecrat
Strom Thurmond&apos;s bid for President. Having been elected to his
first term at the age of 37, Kentucky&apos;s &quot;Boy Governor&quot; was both the
last surviving governor of any U.S. state to serve before 1939 and
the last living Senator to have served before 1940 by the time of
his death in 1991. Contents [hide] 1 Early life 2 Early political

External links Early life Chandler was born in Corydon, Henderson
County Kentucky the son of Joseph Sephus and Callie
Saunders-Chandler. His childhood was a difficult one. According to
his autobiography, his earliest memory was his mother abandoning
the family when he was four years old. Though cared for by his
father and other relatives, by age eight, he was selling newspapers
to supplement the family&apos;s income. At sixteen, his
fourteen-year-old brother died after falling from a tree while
picking cherries. Chandler graduated from high school in 1917, and,
against his father&apos;s wishes, enrolled at Transylvania University in
Lexington, with only &quot;a red sweater, a five dollar bill, and a
smile.&quot; During his matriculation, he starred in three sports,
captaining the basketball and baseball teams, and playing
quarterback on the football team. He also joined the Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity after being denied membership in Kappa Alpha. Throughout
his educational career, he worked odd jobs to support himself. In
the fall semester of 1918, with his nation in the midst of World
War I, Chandler volunteered to serve in the Student Army Training
Corps, although the corps disbanded with the signing of an
armistice in November. Chandler graduated from Transylvania in
1921, taking with him both a bachelor&apos;s degree and his life-long
nickname, &quot;Happy,&quot; which he was given because of his jovial
attitude. From there, Chandler studied at Harvard Law School,
coaching high school athletics to earn money. He returned to
Lexington in 1922, attaining a Bachelor of Laws from the University
of Kentucky two years later. Again, he funded his education by
coaching high school sports in nearby Versailles. For the next five
years, Chandler was an assistant football coach at Centre College
in Danville, simultaneously practicing law in Versailles. While
representing Margaret Hall, an Episcopal girls school, Chandler met
Keysville, Virginia native Mildred Watkins. He eventually persuaded
his new love to break her engagement to another man. Despite
Watkins&apos;s eventual confession of having been married previously and
being the mother of a two-year-old daughter, the two married on
November 12, 1925. Chandler immediately adopted Watkins&apos;s daughter,
Marcella, and the couple eventually had three children together:
Mimi, Ben and Dan. Early political career Chandler&apos;s career in
politics began with an appointment by Judge Ben Williams to the
post of master commissioner of the Woodford County Circuit Court in
1928. Only a year later, he was elected to represent Kentucky&apos;s
22nd Senate District in the Kentucky General Assembly. He made a
name for himself primarily on two issues: the repeal of parimutuel
betting and a plan to build a hydroelectric dam on Cumberland
Falls. Chandler opposed both proposals, and both eventually failed.
Split with Governor Laffoon In 1931, Chandler was elected
lieutenant governor of the state by a wide margin. Although
Chandler and the elected governor, Ruby Laffoon were both
Democrats, Chandler soon split with his running mate and ended up
working against many of his programs, particularly on the issue of
a state sales tax, which Laffoon supported but Chandler opposed. As
lieutenant governor, Chandler also served as the presiding officer
in the state senate, though his political opponents passed measures
to limit his customary powers in retaliation for his split with
Laffoon. Laffoon had hand-picked Thomas Rhea to succeed him as
governor, but Chandler had other ideas. Advised by political
allies, Chandler made the boldest move of his political career.
Acting as governor while Laffoon was out of the state ? as provided
by the Kentucky Constitution at the time ? Chandler called the
legislature into special session and pushed through a bill calling
for candidates for governor to be chosen by primaries rather than
elected at the party conventions. This bucking of the political
machine made him a hero in the eyes of many voters. First term as
governor Chandler did succeed in his bid for governor in 1935,
defeating Rhea in a runoff primary and disposing of Republican
challenger King Swope by a hefty margin. At a mere 37 years old,
Chandler was dubbed the &quot;Boy Governor.&quot; As promised, he quickly
oversaw the repeal of the state&apos;s sales tax, compensating for the
financial loss to the state by raising excise and income taxes. The
1935 repeal of Kentucky&apos;s prohibition amendment gave Chandler a
further source of revenue ? a tax on whiskey. Frugality and fiscal
responsibility became hallmarks of Chandler&apos;s administration. The
Government Reorganization Act of 1936 so streamlined the state&apos;s
bureaucracy that Chandler was able to cut the state&apos;s outstanding
debt by 75%, a whopping $28.5 million. Chandler increased spending
on several projects and proposals throughout his term, however. He
supported the state&apos;s Old Age Pension Law and created a pension
fund for the state&apos;s teachers. In 1936, he allocated $2 million to
improve the state&apos;s rural roads and led the state to participate in
the federal Rural Electrification Act. He also provided for free
textbooks for students in public schools, and dramatically
increased funding for schools, colleges, and universities in the
state. By the end of Chandler&apos;s first year in office, University of
Kentucky president Frank L. McVey proclaimed that &quot;much more has
been accomplished than would have been thought possible.&quot;
Chandler&apos;s heroics continued during the Ohio River flood of 1937,
when he personally supervised the evacuation of a partly-flooded
penitentiary in Frankfort. Though he opposed the closed shop and
sit-down strike tactics used by the state&apos;s labor unions, Chandler
also earned a reputation as a friend of organized labor by creating
a state Department of Industrial Relations and supporting the
federal Child Labor Amendment, though it was never ratified. During
his tenure as governor, he earned Doctor of Laws degrees from
Transylvania in 1936 and the University of Kentucky College of Law
in 1937. Service in the United States Senate In 1938, while still
serving as governor, Chandler challenged Senate Majority Leader
(and future Vice President) Alben Barkley in the Democratic primary
for Barkley&apos;s seat in Congress. Though Chandler lost to the very
popular Barkley, President Franklin D. Roosevelt felt compelled to
make a trip to the state to support Barkley&apos;s candidacy. Chandler
would get his chance at the Senate soon enough, however. In 1939,
the state&apos;s junior Senator, M. M. Logan, died. Under an arrangement
with Lieutenant Governor Keen Johnson, Chandler resigned his
position, elevating Johnson to the governorship. Johnson, in turn,
appointed Chandler to fill Logan&apos;s seat in the Senate. Chandler
retained the seat in a special election in 1940, and was re-elected
to a full term in 1942, defeating former ally John Y. Brown. During
his tenure in the Senate, Chandler usually backed the policies of
President Roosevelt. As a member of the Senate&apos;s Military Affairs
Committee, he was vocal in his opposition to prioritizing the
European front over defeating Japan in World War II. He and five
other senators toured American military bases, successfully
lobbying to strengthen those in the Aleutian Islands area. It was
also during his time in the Senate that he developed a friendship
with comedian Bob Hope. Commissioner of Baseball When baseball&apos;s
first commissioner, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, died in 1944, an
official in the War Department began campaigning for Chandler&apos;s
election to the post. Despite being the last candidate put forth in
the April 1945 meetings, he was elected by a unanimous vote of the
team owners, and resigned his Senate seat in October of that year.
Chandler clashed with Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo &quot;the Lip&quot;
Durocher over Durocher&apos;s association with gambling figures and his
marriage to actress Laraine Day, which came amid allegations from
Day&apos;s ex-husband that Durocher had stolen her away from him. Before
the start of the 1947 season, Chandler suspended Durocher for the
entire season, citing &quot;conduct detrimental to baseball.&quot; The
Dodgers went on to win the pennant that season under replacement
manager Burt Shotton. Chandler became known as &quot;the players&apos;
commissioner&quot; for his work on their behalf. During his service, he
presided over the establishment of a pension fund for players, but
his most significant contribution was overseeing the initial steps
toward integration of the major leagues, beginning with the debut
of Jackie Robinson with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. This move was
controversial with some team owners, who voted 15-1 against
integrating the sport in a secret January 1947 meeting. The
Dodgers&apos; Branch Rickey met with Chandler, who agreed to back the
team&apos;s move. Chandler&apos;s stance was credited by many in the sports
community with Chandler&apos;s failure to be selected for another term
as Commissioner after the expiration of his first one in 1951.
Chandler was fully aware that he was jeopardizing his own
commissionership by stewarding the integration process. Chandler&apos;s
attitude was a simple one, which he conveyed to Branch Rickey, and
later recounted in his autobiography: &quot;I&apos;ve already done a lot of
thinking about this whole racial situation in our country. As a
member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, I got to know a
lot about our casualties during the war. Plenty of Negro boys were
willing to go out and fight and die for this country. Is it right
when they came back to tell them they can&apos;t play the national
pastime? You know, Branch, I&apos;m going to have to meet my Maker some
day. And if He asks me why I didn&apos;t let this boy play, and I say
it&apos;s because he&apos;s black, that might not be a satisfactory answer.
If the Lord made some people black, and some white, and some red or
yellow, he must have had a pretty good reason. It isn&apos;t my job to
decide which colors can play big league baseball. It is my job to
see that the game is fairly played and that everybody has an equal
chance. I think if I do that, I can face my Maker with a clear
conscience.&quot; Second term as governor After being forced out as
Commissioner of Baseball, Chandler returned to Versailles and
continued to practice law. His hiatus from public life would be
short lived, however. While prohibited by the Kentucky Constitution
from serving consecutive terms as governor, nothing prohibited
Chandler from seeking a second gubernatorial term in 1955, twenty
years after his first bid. He secured the Democratic nomination
over challenger Bert T. Combs, and took the general election from
Republican Edwin R. Denney by landslide. Much had changed in the
years since Chandler&apos;s first term as governor. In 1948, he had
embraced the &quot;Dixiecrats,&quot; a Southern faction that had broken from
the national Democratic Party, and their segregationist
presidential nominee, Strom Thurmond. This move had alienated him
from some in his own party at the state level as well.
Nevertheless, he was able to make positive changes in the state in
his second term, continuing his themes of improving education and
public works. He oversaw the establishment of the University of
Kentucky Medical Center which bears his name. Having already
integrated baseball, in 1956, Chandler used National Guard troops
to enforce racial integration of schools in two Kentucky towns.
Later career Chandler remained active in Kentucky politics long
after his final term as governor ended. He lost the Democratic
gubernatorial primary to Edward T. Breathitt in 1963, and to Henry
Ward in 1967. After the 1967 primary loss, Chandler jumped parties
to support Republican Louie B. Nunn, who won the election. George
Wallace considered Chandler as his running mate in his 1968
campaign for the Presidency as a third party candidate;  as one of
Wallace&apos;s aides put it, &quot;We have all the nuts in the country, we
could get some decent people ? you working one side of the street
and he working the other side.&quot; Wallace invited Chandler, but when
the press published the prospect, Wallace&apos;s supporters, especially
the John Birch Society objected: Chandler had supported the hiring
of Jackie Robinson by the Brooklyn Dodgers, and had protected black
children from violence during the integration of the Kentucky
schools. Wallace retracted the invitation, and chose Curtis LeMay
instead. In his last years, Chandler remained active as a member of
the Boards of Trustees of both Transylvania University and the
University of Kentucky. During a meeting of the University of
Kentucky Board of Trustees finance committee on April 5, 1988,
Chandler drew the ire of several student groups by using a racial
epithet. During a discussion of the university&apos;s 1985 decision to
dispose of its investments in South Africa, Chandler, a member of
the Board, remarked &quot;You know Zimbabwe&apos;s all nigger now. There
aren&apos;t any whites.&quot; He later apologized for his comments. Legacy
Chandler was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. At age
89, he collaborated with author Vance Trimble to pen his
autobiography, Heroes, Plain Folks, and Skunks. Kentucky governors
still host a breakfast at the Governor&apos;s Mansion on the morning of
the Kentucky Derby, a tradition started by Governor and Mrs.
Chandler in 1936. Chandler died in Versailles, Kentucky on June 15,
1991. According to his family, he died of a heart attack. He was
buried at the Pisgah Church Cemetery in Versailles. At the time of
his death, Chandler was the earliest U.S. governor of any state
still living;  he had held that distinction since the death of
Alfred M. Landon. He was also the last surviving U.S. Senator from
the 1930s. Happy&apos;s grandson, Ben Chandler, is currently a member of
the United States House of Representatives and formerly served as
Kentucky State Auditor and Attorney General of Kentucky. Ben
Chandler ran for Governor of Kentucky in 2003 as the Democratic
nominee but lost to Republican candidate Ernie Fletcher. According
to Ben, until he was 13 he aspired to be a baseball player just as
his grandfather. We gave the cache some CPR &amp;amp;

2009-09-21 ReedKyCacheFinders, We was out house hunting today down in Union County &amp; thought we would just check on this one since it was moved. It wasn&apos;t moved to far from where it use to sit &amp; still should be a easy P&amp;G &amp; going to leave the coords as is.
We think it&apos;s kind of funning to that the workers that moved it didn&apos;t see it or knock it off from it&apos;s hiding area [:D]

2009-09-12 Hunts with Wine, Our information was downloaded before your note about the move.   But we figured it out on our own and laughed when we thought of the constuction men moving it to the new location without even seeing it as it was still there.

The Missouri Well Rounded Cacher 
&quot;Fizzy Challenge&quot;

History
GC11E8N, the original &quot;Fizzy Challenge&quot; was published in California
on April 6, 2007. Kealia, the owner of the first Fizzy Challenge
created the cache in honor of a local cacher, FizzyMagic. Including
this cache, there are currently 26 active Fizzy Challenges across
the United States. Other Fizzy Challenges include ?
CA IN WA CO MA NC BC UT MN ID KY
TN VA OR FL PA TX OH GA IL WY MD
AZ MI WI AL
It?s important to keep in mind this cache is not for everyone.
To accomplish finds for each of the 81 required combinations will
test your intellectual skills, your physical fitness, and your
endurance. Those who complete the requirements for this cache are
truly ?Well Rounded Cachers.?
Requirements
To be able to claim a find on this cache, you will need to first
?
Find at least one cache of every difficulty/terrain combination
(81 unique combinations).
As part of those finds, you will need to have at least one find of
10 of the 14 cache types shown below (the different cache types
count against the 81, so if you find a 3.0/2.5 multi cache, it
fulfills both requirements).
 Traditional Cache
Multi Cache
Mystery Cache
 Virtual Cache
Project Ape
 Letterbox Hybrid
 EarthCache
Locationless
Webcam Cache
 Event Cache
CITO Event
 Wherigo Cache
 Mega Event
 GPS Adventure
Note of the 10 needed cache types, you?ll need to find at least
one of the following somewhat rare/archived: Project APE, Mega
Event, Locationless, GPS Adventure, or Whereigo. In the case of the
Locationless caches, you can not log a now archived cache, but you
can count a find made and logged before the Locationless caches
were archived.
As part of your 81 caches, include a cache of every size;  i.e.,
large, regular, small, micro, and not chosen.
Included in your 81 caches, find a cache placed in every year from
2000 through the current year (e.g., from 2000 to 2009 for a total
of 10 caches).
Tracking
How you track your finds is up to you. There are a number of
options. We encourage you to pick the one that best suits your
needs. No matter how you keep track, please post your progress on
this cache page.
You can create a bookmark list to keep track, and be sure to
include this cache in your list.
When you&apos;re done, be sure to alert me of your status before
logging the cache. The best way is to send an email to me through
my profile along with a bookmark of your pertinent finds. Logged
finds without prior documentation of completing the requirements
will be deleted.
Additional Rules
All previous cache finds count ? you do not have to start from
?0? and your finds can be from outside the state of Missouri.

Generally accepted rules, guidelines, and conditions for logging a
find apply ? all finds must be caches listed on geocaching.com that
you have personally (physically) found.
If others are with you when you find the final, only those who have
fulfilled all the criteria for this cache will be allowed to log
the cache as a find.
This particular cache does not count as the 5/5 in the matrix ? you
must find a 5/5 before this one.
There is no cut-off date ? you?re on your honor to fulfill these
requirements with caches using legitimate difficulty and terrain
ratings that have not been padded or altered to meet a fizzy
requirement.
Residents of other states may log the Missouri Fizzy Challenge at
any time.
The Final
The first step in logging the final is to send me a bookmark
containing the appropriate caches indicating you&apos;ve completed the
challenge.

The cache itself is actually a 1/1.5, but the d/t level is due to
the logging requirements. It is located in one of my favorite State
Parks, Trail of Tears State Park, in Southeast Missouri. You&apos;ll be
visiting the site of a major historical event in our nation&apos;s
history, and you?ll be looking for a fully stocked ammo box. It is
a fmaily friendly cache. Please take time to read the information
available at the site and to stop by the Visitor&apos;s Center to learn
more about the role this area played in the development of our
country.
If you are unsure as to whether any of your finds will qualify
for d/t grid, please ask.

2009-12-28 Tprints, Posting my note to say that I&apos;ve added my BookMark list of all 81+ caches needed for this challenge. I may be in the area in a couple months and hope to find it then. Thanks.
Write note
2009-08-03 Barrin the Wanderer, If I&apos;m reading your question right, you want to know if you can use more than 81 caches to fulfill the requirements for the different cache types, the different cache sizes, and the different placement year requirements.  If that is the correct way to interpret your question, then yes, you may use more than 81 caches, as long as you have found all 81 difficulty/terrain levels.
Write note
2009-08-03 fiddlish, Having just finished the MO County Challenge, the MO DeLorme Challenge, and the KC Iconic Day Challenge, we turn our eyes now to this!  It will probably take some time, since our d/t chart is pretty sparse on the 4.5 and 5 ends!

Two questions:  First, are you allowed to submit more than 81 total caches in order to fulfill the different parts of the requirement?

Second, if a cache we found is no longer active, may we still use it?

Thanks!

Cache was easy to find, but mind the plant life.  Gates close, even though we couldn&apos;t find the hours on the park website.  Glad to visit the latest version of the Fizzy/WRC club!

 <desc>Choctaw Park Cache, Re-engineered by capegcachers
Cache ID: GC1TQ6Y
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D3.0/T1.5
DESC: This is a very easily accessible cache.
This cache is a completely re-engineered cache to replace our old Choctaw Park Cache.  It is in the same park, but that is where any similarities end.  You are looking for a small micro and you will need to bring your own pen.  This is pretty effectively camouflaged and hopefully will be more muggle proof than its predecessor.

Choctaw Park is a small city park nestled in the middle of fast food heaven. Take your pick of several fast food places all within walking distance of this little park. So grab a picnic meal and bring it over to Choctaw Park and enjoy the pavilion and small playground while you are geocaching.

DESC: 
This cache is located near the Carbondale Cedar Lake boat dock.  The boat dock area is open from 6AM to 10 PM.  There are bathrooms and picnic tables at the docks.  Cache is along a footpath trail.  A reference point for the trailhead is included.  Cache is a small rubbermaid container that will hold small items but there is not a pencil so BYOP.  You are looking for a tree about fifty feet into the woods that appears to be growing on its side.  The cache is under the branches.  

When we got home, we were covered in very small ticks, so we suggest bug spray.  Sorry, I don&apos;t know if we walked through a nest or what, but that was the most (and smallest)  we have ever seen.  Trail is somewhat grown up so that probably didn&apos;t help.   Happy Hunting!

2009-12-26 Micd, The last one we were trying to get in the dark didn&apos;t pan out so well.
The police followed us to GZ &amp; asked what we were doing? I explained 
caching to him &amp; then he said, well, go get it, but be carefull due to the high water.
I said we would &amp; off we went with our flash lights. Had a quick look around &amp; didn&apos;t see
it right off, so we came back out to the road as he was not leaving. We had another chat with him
explaing some more about caching &amp; off we went. He had no problem with us being there once he knew what we were doing. Thanx for the hunt.

This cache is located relatively high, if you are short you may have difficulty getting to it, however for the average height person no climbing is involved, just a good boost from your tip toes will do.  You are looking for a black film canister and you will need to bring along your own pen.

She seemed friendly enough and decided to bound around and follow me while I was looking for the cache.  When I found it I set it on the ground to take out the stuff.  There were all kinds of pamphlets and magnets and wooden coins inside.  She ran up and took the cache, dumping everything out and running about 100 yards away before dropping the cache.  Luckily there was not a single muggle in sight.  I took a picture of her she was so cute.  :D  I was able to pick up everything and get it back in some kind of order.

Samuel H. Dalton was born a slave in November 1839. When he was freed under the Emancipation Proclamation, Dalton enlisted in the Union Navy and was assigned to the U.S.S. Juliet, a gunboat patrolling the Mississippi River. After the war, he moved to Cairo, Illinois, and then to Carbondale, Illinois, where he married his first wife, Mary Stanton, 
 

In the 1870&apos;s, sometime around 1887, he moved to Murphysboro and purchased a small home for $150 from the John A. Logan estate. In October 1891 Dalton became a charter member of the Murphysboro Post #728 (colored) of the Grand Army of the Republic. Dalton married his second wife, Lumisa Hall, in his house in 1892. The small home was shared by the Daltons, Lumisa?s sister, and two small nephews. Dalton died on June 7, 1920. 

This cache in honor of Mr. Dalton and his contributions to the Murphysboro community. Cache includes small items, log book, and pencil.

DESC: Post Oak Trail is Handicap Accessible. Arrow-Wood Interpretive Trail is difficulty level of 1.5.  Giant City Trail is a 2.5 with some moderately steep locations.
This is an EarthCache.  The coordinates will take you to a starting point outside the Visitor&apos;s Center.  Trail maps and information are available at the Visitors Center from 8AM - 4PM daily.
&quot;With its breathtaking natural beauty and unlimited opportunities for outdoor recreation, a trip to Giant City State Park near Carbondale is sure to delight visitors of all ages. From camping and horseback riding to fishing and rappelling, it&apos;s an outdoor lover&apos;s paradise. Visitors will marvel at the many wilderness trails, and a sure treat awaits anyone hiking the Giant City Nature Trail, home of the &quot;Giant City Streets&quot; formed 12,000 years ago by huge bluffs of sandstone.&quot;
Nestled in the Shawnee National Forest, just minutes south of Carbondale, the area was named for the unique impressions made by its massive sandstone structures. Eons of geological faulting and folding have molded a landscape like none other, which is now clothed in lush garments of fern, moss, large flowering mints, hundreds of species of wild flowers and 75-plus varieties of towering trees. The natural splendor of Giant City has made it a renowned retreat that attracts more than 1.2 million visitors annually.
&quot;Shelter bluffs, or rock shelters, worn into the sides of the cliffs have revealed evidence of human habitation in this region from as early as 10,000 years ago, and the blackened ceilings caused by their fires are still visible today. On an 80-foot sandstone cliff near the main entrance, one can see the remains of a Native American stone wall that was erected between A.D. 600-800.
The first European settlers moved into the area from Kentucky and Tennessee in the early 1800s, and by 1850, settlers were using the land to cultivate fruit trees. During the Civil War, many of the cliffs and canyons were used as havens by soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies.
By the early 1900s, many biologists, geologists and visitors had become intrigued with the region for study and relaxation. It provided ample opportunity for both.
In 1927, the State of Illinois acquired more than 1,100 acres of land in Union and Jackson counties and dedicated the area as Giant City State Park.
The Visitor Center provides interpretive displays on the geology, plants, animals, and history of the park. An audio-visual room with a running 10 minute film about the park guides visitors through the interesting features.&quot;
Geology:
The sandstone bluffs of the Shawnee Hills were formed more than 250 million years ago as the sandbars and dunes of a river delta that drained the Pennsylvanian swamps of Illinois.  This delta emptied freshwater into a shallow ocean just to the south.  These sand sediments compacted over millions of years becoming sandstone.  Earthquakes, faulting and folding, created the hills, bluffs and fissures in the rock.  Over millions of years, erosion by wind and water have etched the bluffs by removing softer areas of stone.  Observe the pocket-like depressions called honeycombs.
This hill of sandstone sits atop Drury shale which is slippery and breaks easily. Past earth movements and glacial melt waters of 12,000 yrs ago aided in the sliding of the sandstone leaving narrow canyons between the bluffs.  Some geologists think that acidic rainwater also aided in this process.


Please take some time and explore the following trails:

Arrowwood Self-Interpretive Nature Trail
Just off of the parking lot at the Visitors Center lies Giant City&apos;s newest trail. This 1/3 mile tree identification trail is an easy walk through a young forest. Twelve interpretive signs are located along the trail with tips on identification and uses of trees. Hike this trail first for a refresher on many of the trees of Giant City.

Post Oak Nature Trail
This 1/3 mile handicapped-accessible trail winds along the top of a beautiful forested sandstone cliff. The paved trail leads visitors through many natural experiences including viewing the life around a small wildlife pond and exploring a dry bluff top oak forest with gorgeous overlooks. This trail is also perfect for elderly visitors or parents with very young children.

Giant City Nature Trail 
By far the most popular trail at Giant City, this 1 mile trail is home to the famous &quot;streets&quot; of Giant City. The massive sandstone bluffs and the narrow shaded areas between them resemble a city, thus the name &quot;Giant City&quot; was coined. You&apos;ll walk on a mulched trail with wooden walkways at difficult spots. There are some strenuous uphill portions on this trail. Take this trail to view a diversity of plant habitats from creek bottomland to dry bluff top. This is also a promising trail for seeing the largest woodpecker in the United States, the pileated woodpecker.

This is a VERY small micro cache that only contains a log sheet so BYOP. Definitely a park and grab. Area is heavily populated with muggles so be stealthy. This cache is Handicap Accessible. Log Sheet is small, so please post when it is full and I will replace it.

The Beatle from the Black Hawk
War


 This cache is meant to be a creative hide with a twist of fun;  all
the while being respectful of all those who tread here before us.
The name of this cache is fictitious and is just a coincidence that
the names matched. This grave yard is one of the oldest in the
area. You will find buried here everyday citizens along with
soldiers from different wars. A war veteran and his horse are
buried at the last site from which you gather clues.

 

You will need to bring with you a writing instrument, paper,
clipboard, and a dime or a flat screw driver to help you complete
this task.

 
The listed coordinates are for the parking
area.


 

Correct cache coordinates
N37*_ _. _ _ _ W088*_ _. _ _ _
1. Find Sarah Ann Appleton?s year of birth 18 _ _ . The last two
digits are the first two numbers of the coordinates.
2. Find Nannie and H. C. Hopper?s year of death _ _ _ _ and
subtract 902 to arrive at the answer for the next three digits of
the first coordinate.
3. Next, Patrick Henry Lang the Veteran of the Mexican War will
give you your next answer. Find his age and subtract 2 to complete
this portion of the mystery cache.
4. Find the location of the Beatle from the Black Hawk war. Once
found look for the next to last letter of the last name. This
letter will represent the numeral for the next blank.
5. Now count the letters of the first name and this will give
you the next digit.
6. Last but not least, count the number of R?s in the last name
and this will complete the coordinate sequence needed to find the
cache.
7. Now pay your respects and be sure to thank a veteran before
you finish this cache.

.
 
Please place the cache back
exactly as you found it.



Happy Caching!

So armed with a &quot;Christmas Hint&quot; today, we came back at the edge of dark to make the find. It still was a challenge, but comming all the way from Canada, it was nice to get a FTF on this one.  So to the locals, it is there, come find it. Thanx for the tuff hide &amp; the little extra.

We tried to figure coordinates out by your first posting (we see they have been updated now) and were sure we would be FTF on this one!! But, due to your error on death/birth question, we came up empty handed. I guess we will have to surrender our FTF smiley this time around. Maybe when we come in town for Christmas, we&apos;ll try again! [:(!]

[red] DISABLING CACHE: [/red]


Greetings,

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last couple logs on this cache, it appears that this cache may be  in need of repair or at least should be checked.   Since there may  still be  a container in the  area, I can not archive it.  When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then.

Hope things get fixed up soon.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

If everything turns out to be fine you can enable this  at any time. 

[b]If I do not hear from you about fixing up this cache, I will assume that it is abandoned  and archive this cache  sometime in the future.  We need to work to maintain the good relationships we have with the parks in the area. We cannot afford to let our caches turn into litter.

Post Reviewer Note
2009-06-13 *gln, Greetings,

I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs.

I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache.
[b]
If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.
[/b] 

If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. 


From the guidelines...       http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint      &quot;... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem.  This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b]  normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing.&quot;  

Thanks for your understanding.

When you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an &quot;Owner Maintenance&quot; log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don&apos;t let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!

2008-09-01 Coordinated Raptor, Found it with my son. The cache had slipped down inside the hide to where I couldn&apos;t get to it. Had to lift Adam up nice and high and have him reach down to it with his skinny arm. Replaced it so an adult can get to it.
Found it
2008-05-11 Hobbit Taz, This one took a little more &quot;lineing&quot; up to get to.  My first thought was the area had been changed alot since the photo was taken, but CribbageWitch pulled up to a spot and said I think it was here and after a briefly taking another look at the area decided she was correct.  We followed the caches line of sight and went right to it.
TFTC and interesting concept (has given me a thought to a little diffent hide of my own).

Stayed over after attending the SEMOG WWFM event yesterday and doing a day of caching up until the rain forced us into an early quitting time.  Today is a new day.  Even though it was a cold WINDY start to the day, it did finally get just enough better to make it another good full day of caching (although we did head home before dark due to other committments).

I didn&apos;t have any cards to leave, so I left a bunch of heart charms and a big copper heart pendent and took the Wicked Witch doll.. What a very very cool idea for a cache! Thanks so much for brining us out here. It was lovely. And our dog - LOVED the grass. He rolled, and rolled, and SCRUBBED his fur into grass. We laughed so hard at him - he was covered with fallen leaves by the time he was through but he was SO happy.

I think we arrived at this site right as another cacher was departing (or was it a wedding participant leaving wa-a-ay late?)  In any case, this one allowed me to save LJT from getting too far off course and have to, perhaps, throw him a rope.  It looked to me like the coords were pretty good, but quite often I don&apos;t understand how he goes so far astray.  Thanks for all the fun!

2009-05-07 Lumberjack Tom, Hickman County, one of four Kentucky counties that border the Mississippi River, was named for Captain Paschal Hickman, who was massacred by indians at the Battle of the River Raisin in 1813 during the War of 1812.  Old Kentucky liked this area of Kentucky.  He thought it only fitting that a land with so much running water in the form of springs, streams and creeks would eventually melt into the Mighty Mississippi itself.

Found as part of the Kentucky County Challenge.

As I was preparing to jump the creek, I heard Smee yell &quot;YooHoo!&quot; and knew my shoes would stay dry after all.  Whew!  Many thanks-- and congratulations and Happy Anniversary!

Hurricane Wilma was the most intense hurricane that has ever been recorded in the Atlantic basin. It devastated parts of the Yucatán Peninsula and southern Florida during October in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Wilma set numerous records for both strength and seasonal activity. Wilma was only the third Category 5 ever to develop in the month of October and with the formation of Hurricane Wilma, the 2005 season became the most active on record, exceeding the 21 storms of the 1933 season. Wilma was the twenty-second storm (including the subtropical storm discovered in reanalysis), thirteenth hurricane, sixth major hurricane, and fourth Category 5 hurricane of the record-breaking season.

Wilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, Cuba, and the U.S. state of Florida. At least 63 deaths were reported, and damage is estimated at over $28.9 billion ($20.6 billion in the US;  2005 US dollars),[1] ranking Wilma among the top 5 costliest hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic and the third costliest storm in U.S. history.


A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the Caribbean Sea from an upper-level low across the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. A broad area of low pressure developed on October 13 to the southeast of Jamaica, and slowly became more concentrated as upper-level wind shear gradually decreased. Dvorak classifications began on October 14, and by late on October 15 the surface circulation in the system became well-enough defined, with sufficiently organized deep convection, for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about 220 miles (345 km) east-southeast of Grand Cayman.[1]

 
Radar image of Hurricane Wilma making landfall in South FloridaThe depression drifted southwestward due to the influence of two ridges to its north, and with warm water temperatures and a favorable upper-level environment it strengthened into Tropical Storm Wilma on October 17. Initially, development was slow, due to the large size of the storm and a flat pressure gradient. However, convection gradually organized, and from October 18 through the 19th Wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the Caribbean. In a 30 hour period, the pressure dropped from 982 mbar to the record-low of 882 mbar, while the winds increased to 185 mph (300 km/h).

Wilma weakened after the inner eye dissipated and underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. It turned northwestward, and remained a powerful Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale after the outer 40 mile (65 km) became the dominant eyewall. Late on October 21 Wilma made landfall on Cozumel and later on the Mexican mainland with winds of about 150 mph (240 km/h).[1]

Wilma weakened to a moderate hurricane while over land, and reached the southern Gulf of Mexico on October 23. A powerful trough turned the hurricane to the northeast and caused to accelerate its forward motion. Its large eye remained well-organized, allowing Wilma to intensify despite increasing amounts of wind shear. It briefly reached winds of 125 mph (200 km/h) before hitting Cape Romano, Florida as a 120 mph (195 km/h) major hurricane. Wilma crossed the state in about 4.5 hours and weakened to winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) after entering the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter. Possibly due to less friction of the eyewall or moving over warm waters of the Gulf Stream, Wilma again re-intensified to reach winds of 125 mph (200 km/h) before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection. On October 26 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and the next day the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over Atlantic Canada

Hurricane Katrina was the costliest and one of the deadliest hurricanes in the history of the United States. It was the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded and the third-strongest hurricane on record that made landfall in the United States. Katrina formed on August 23 during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and caused devastation along much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States. The most severe loss of life and property damage occured in New Orleans, which flooded as the levee system failed catastrophically, in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland.[1] The hurricane caused severe destruction across the entire Mississippi coast and into Alabama, as far as 100 miles (160 km) from the storm&apos;s center. Katrina was the eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, third major hurricane, and second Category 5 hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic season.

It formed over the Bahamas on August 23, 2005, and crossed southern Florida as a moderate Category 1 hurricane, causing some deaths and flooding there, before strengthening rapidly in the Gulf of Mexico and becoming one of the strongest hurricanes on record while at sea. The storm weakened before making its second and third landfalls as a Category 3 storm on the morning of August 29 in southeast Louisiana and at the Louisiana/Mississippi state line, respectively.

The storm surge caused severe damage along the Gulf Coast, devastating the Mississippi cities of Bay St. Louis, Waveland, Biloxi, Gulfport, Ocean Springs, and Pascagoula. In Louisiana, the flood protection system in New Orleans failed in 53 different places. Nearly every levee in metro New Orleans breached as Hurricane Katrina passed east of the city, subsequently flooding 80% of the city and many areas of neighboring parishes for weeks.[1]

At least 1,836 people lost their lives in Hurricane Katrina and in the subsequent floods, making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. The storm is estimated to have been responsible for $81.2 billion (2005 U.S. dollars) in damage, making it the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Criticism of the federal, state and local governments&apos; reaction to the storm was widespread and resulted in an investigation by the United States Congress and the resignation of FEMA director Michael Brown. The storm also prompted Congressional review of the US Army Corps of Engineers and the failure of the levee protection system
Hurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23, 2005 as the result of an interaction of a tropical wave and the remains of Tropical Depression Ten. The system was upgraded to tropical storm status on the morning of August 24 and at this point, the storm was given the name Katrina. The tropical storm continued to move towards Florida, and became a hurricane only two hours before it made landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida on the morning of August 25. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico.[2]

The storm rapidly intensified after entering the Gulf, partly because of the storm&apos;s movement over the warm waters of the Loop Current.[3] On August 27, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, becoming the third major hurricane of the season. An eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification, but caused the storm to nearly double in size. Katrina again rapidly intensified, attaining Category 5 status on the morning of August 28 and reached its peak strength at 1:00 p.m. CDT that day, with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 902 mbar. The pressure measurement made Katrina the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma later in the season;  it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico at the time (a record also later broken by Rita).[2]

Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT[2] on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 120 miles (190 km) from the center and the storm&apos;s central pressure was 920 mbar. After moving over southeastern Louisiana and Breton Sound, it made its third landfall near the Louisiana/Mississippi border with 120 mph (195 km/h) sustained winds, still at Category 3 intensity.[2]

Katrina maintained hurricane strength well into Mississippi, but weakened thereafter, finally losing hurricane strength more than 150 miles (240 km) inland near Meridian, Mississippi. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee, but its remnants were last distinguishable in the eastern Great Lakes region on August 31, when it was absorbed by a frontal boundary. The resulting extratropical storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected Ontario and Quebec

SIZE: Small
D1.0/T1.0
DESC: An easy cache at SIU.
The cache is a small painted metal box, moderately concealed. It is near a very large and very interesting piece of sculpture on Southern Illinois University Campus. As with any university, parking may be a bit of a challenge, although there are parking lots within a few hundred feet. Several buildings nearby may be being renovated at any time, and I would advise cachers to avoid them. Although the cache is wheelchair accesible, it is on a small hill which is steep enough to present a challenge to a person alone in a wheelchair.
Hint: Cache is not in a tree or in a sculpture.

SIZE: Regular
D1.0/T1.5
DESC: Welcome to the Gower House, once thought to be one of the nicest
inns between Louisville and New Orleans. The hotel played host to a
number of famous people ... some of whom may never have left, even
though they ?checked out.?
Please restrict your search to the grounds of the Gower House,
noted with a historic marker next to the road. Explore all you like
outside and on the porches before 10 p.m. Feel free to peek inside,
but do not enter any doors you may find unlocked. Because of
liability issues, the property owner is restricting access while
the building is being renovated. Caching after 10 p.m. is not
permitted because of noise and lights disturbing nearby residents. 
History
The Gower House is named after former caretaker and eventual owner
Stanley P. Gower. It was built as an inn for river travelers
sometime between 1780 and 1830, depending upon which local
historian you believe. At times it was also known as Bell
Tavern.

 
Visitors may have included: U.S. presidents James K. Polk,
Zachary Taylor, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S.
Grant;  Vice President Aaron Burr;  Revolutionary War generals
Lafayette and Benedict Arnold;  American Red Cross founder Clara
Barton;  ?Great Compromiser? Henry Clay;  authors Charles Dickens,
Lew Wallace (Ben-Hur) and Ned Buntline (father of the dimestore
novel);  opera singer Jenny Lind;  and naturalist John James Audubon.
Historical papers document Buntline?s stay. The others have not
been authenticated, although some apparently visited the town
during the time the inn was open.
Folklore
Local legend suggests the house is haunted by a myriad of spirits.
Modern day evidence has included strange recordings made in the
house, one of which appears to be a voice shouting ?Get out!? The
owner?s eldest son also said he heard laughter and was tapped on
the shoulder while trimming the lawn one day. He looked around to
find ... no one.

 
Who are these haunts? There are several possibilities.
The Gower House was used as a headquarters and hospital during
the Civil War, when Union troops occupied Smithland. Civil War
uniform buttons are among the archaological evidence unearthed
here. Some of the sick were put in ?the dark rooms,? small
downstairs rooms without windows. They may have died there in the
darkness. Could they be there still?
? Ned Buntline supposedly brought his beautiful young Cuban
bride, Seberina, with him to the Gower House after being run out of
Nashville, Tenn., for his political views. He still had business in
Nashville, so visited from time to time. On one trip, he was
accused of having an affair with the wife of his friend and
business partner, Robert Porterfield. Buntline and Porterfield
dueled with pistols, and Buntline killed Porterfield. An angry mob
of Porterfield supporters dragged Buntline to the public square and
hanged him, but he had friends in the crowd who cut him down and
smuggled him away.
Legend says Buntline never returned to the Gower House to claim
his bride and that she, perhaps learning of his betrayal, died of a
broken heart. Years later, grave-diggers supposedly dug into her
unmarked grave by mistake while preparing for a burial. They knew
it was her because of her long, dark hair. Time was limited because
the funeral procession was due at any time, so the men quickly
closed the coffin, shoveled a little dirt on top, packed it down
and waited for the other casket to arrive. It was buried on top of
her. Some say that now she walks from the town cemetery to Gower
House, checking to see if her husband has returned for her.
? Some believe the house is inhabited by Mary Zanone, whose
family purchased the Gower House in 1860. The family came from
Genoa, Italy, where they had owned vineyards and become wealthy.
Supposedly one of Mary?s silk dresses caught fire from sparks from
an open fireplace. She ran out onto the second floor of the porch,
where she fell to her death.
? Dr. John Brown is said to have entered the inn?s dining room
drunk and abusive. The clerk asked him to leave, but Brown refused.
They got into a fight involving fists, knives and pistols. Brown
died in the street outside. The clerk died in the doorway.
? The circuit judge often held court across the road from the
Gower House under the shade of a large elm tree called the Judge
Elm. From there he provided speedy justice. Convicted criminals
were immediately hanged from one of the branches. Perhaps one of
the condemned haunts the Gower House?
? Joe Brown, said to be the richest man in the city, was stabbed
to death at the Gower House in the early 1800s. The local folk lore
is that the blood stain left upon the floor could not be
removed.
? These days, there is no first floor. A previous owner believed
the rumors that Civil War gold had been buried underneath it. No
trace of the treasure has ever been found. Could a ghost be looking
for the lost loot?
Perhaps you can find a geocache treasure box of your own
instead. Just remember, if you take something, leave something. You
never know who (or what) might be watching.

Welcome to the Jackson Purchase Travel Bug Hospital/Hotel!  Here we can treat anything that ails any trackable item!  From major surgery, like adding a ziploc or printing an info sheet, to just providing a place for a little r&amp;r while it is waiting to be moved on, with a view of the lake none the less!  We are located just off of the purchase parkway which is slated to become part of the I-69 Corridor running from Mexico to Canada.  

Beware of the mugglers who could be walking on the trail or driving on the road! The container is a camo 3 gallon bucket (to open push the red lever and twist) with trade items for those who want to trade and it was placed with permission.  As with most TB hotels please leave at least one TB in the cache so that there is always one for the next cacher to discover!  Also remember to hide as well or better than you found it! When checking on my caches I have noticed that people do not rehide very well some times!  I am not as concerned about my cache as I am about other people&apos;s trackables!!!

Getting to GZ wasn&apos;t bad.... but we search and searched and searched for a good 30-45 minutes.  I crawled around reaching under every rock I could get my hand under, not recommended due to the chance of finding fanged friends hiding, but I keep a extend-a-light in my caching pack for just these occassions.  I spotted the cache just as we were about to give up...... 30 ft away from where my GPS lead us to.... grrrrrrrrrr  :P  Must be another good location for mountaining biking and horseback riding for we ran across both here.

Cache ID: GC14MYE

SIZE: Small
D2.0/T2.5
DESC: large rock that sticks out over a gravel road.nick-named by locals
after actress Debbie Reynolds while she was in the area filming the
1962 epic movie &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;.
Parts of the movie How The West Was Won were shot in this area.
Filming was done along the Ohio River at Cave-in-Rock,Battery Rock
and some fields along the river just East of here. Most of the
locations are now on private property and don&apos;t look anything like
they did in 1962. Equipment trailers , dressing trailers for
actors, etc. were parked in the yard of a nearby farmhouse that now
belongs to a relative of mine. John Wayne, Henry Fonda,Jimmy
Stewart and Debbie Reynolds are just a few of the big name stars
that were in this movie. Debbie Reynolds liked this rock that the
road goes around and commented that she thought it was pretty and
she wished it could be moved to her backyard, thus the name
&quot;Debbie&apos;s Rock&quot;. looks like any other rock to me, but it sure makes
for a good story. In one of the scenes along the river, there is a
large rock in the background. It is actually a corncrib with a tin
roof that was draped with canvas and painted to look like a rock.
Ruins of the crib are still there if you know where to look. check
out the website for more info about the
movie.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056085/ Easy cache close to
road, lots of heavy tree cover and surrounded by hills so gpsr
readings may vary a lot! placed on private property with
permission. small cache, log book only. ps. another well known rock
is also nearby, Hog Rock is just North of here. twice yearly

DESC: Easy hike with some hills to climb on your way out. There are bluffs beside part of the trail about 30ft high.
Lock n lock box painted to match surroundings. It contains log book, pen and the usual small trinkets inside. Beautiful area bring your camera.

Pomona Natural Bridge is 25 feet above a trickling stream. It spans 90 feet and is 6 to 9 feet wide and about 8 feet thick. It&apos;s a perfect hiking and picnic location. 
The dirt trail to the bridge is a short, 1/3 mile loop through a mature oak-hickory and beech forest. As the trail descends to the creek you will come upon an overlook revealing the bridge from above. The bridge is made of sandstone. The arch was made by water erosion.
Hint: Off the Trail, Where a Pooh may live.

DESC: Multi-stage cache, coordinates lead you to the first stage of the cache.
This is the first of what I hope are many to follow Stoddard County Cemetery Caches (SCCC).

At the first stage, visit with Daniel.  Find the day of the month he was born and subtract 1 to solve for AB.  Find the Company he served with and subtract 57 to solve for CD.  Plug those numbers into this set of coordinates:

N 36 57.9AB
W 090 03.4CD

This will take you to the second stage.  Visit with E.V. (my Grandpa).  Find his age and add 1 to solve for EF.  The number of children he and my grandma had = D.

N 36 57.EF4
W 090 03.D90

I hope you enjoy this cache.  Original contents include party favor toys, a water gun, activity books, CDs, a magnet, a safety vest, OFF towelettes.

Congratulations to JoeMap for the FTF!

DESC: There is a bit of steep terrain to get to the final stage. You
are looking for a camo&apos;d .Soda Bottle Preform
Stars and Stripes is the newspaper published for the United
States Armed Forces overseas. It is available in three formats: the
European Edition, the Mideast Edition, and the Pacific Edition.
On 9 November 1861, during the Civil War, soldiers of the
Illinois 11th, 18th, and 29th Regiments, after forcing the
Confederates south, set up camp in Bloomfield, Missouri. Upon
finding the newspaper office empty, they decided to print a
newspaper for their expedition, relating the troop&apos;s activities.
They called it the Stars and Stripes.
Today, the Stars and Stripes Museum / Library Association is in
Bloomfield.
In World War I, the staff and roving reporters and illustrators
of the newspaper were veterans of the newspaper world or, more
frequently, talented young soldiers who would later become famous
members of the United States media in the postwar era.
Stars and Stripes was then an eight-page weekly, which reached a
peak of 526,000 readers, relying considerably on the
improvisational efforts of its staff to get it printed in France
and to distribute it to U.S. troops.
In World War II, the newspaper was printed in several editions
in several operating theaters. Again, both newspapermen in uniform
and young soldiers, some of whom would later become important
journalists, filled the staffs and showed zeal and talent in
publishing and delivering the paper on time. Some of the editions
were assembled and printed very close to the front in order to get
the latest information to the most troops.
Stars and Stripes has expanded to an average of 40?48 pages each
day and is still published in tabloid format. The newspaper employs
civilian reporters, and U.S. military senior noncommissioned
officers as reporters, at a number of locations around the
world.
Stop in and tell Delores thanks for allowing the cache to be
placed.
To find the final stage, go to the coordinates at the first
stage. There, find the last name of the individual found on the 6th
row of the 6th column and answer these questions.
How many letters are in his last name? Add two to solve for
A.
From the same last name, subtract two to solve for B.
How many times does that last name appear in the 6th column?
Answer = C.
N36 51.904+AC W089 55.870+B
If A = 9 and C = 3, then AC is 93, not 9 times 3.

2009-10-17 RicknJoy, We headed out this weekend on a 700-mile trip to the Bootheel to finish up the Missouri County Challenge and the Missouri DeLorme Challenge.
This was one of those very cool finds that really make geocaching worthwhile!  We were readers of Stars &amp; Stripes for six years while we lived in Germany, and we still look at it online sometimes.  We had no idea that it originated in rural southern Missouri, and we might have driven right past the museum had it not been for the cache here!  After stopping at the monument and figuring out the final coordinates, we had a very nice guided tour through the museum and watched the video before going back outside and finding the cache.

DESC: This is just a fun, easy, whimsical cache.  It involves a short, but rather steep hike up a hillside.  It is placed in the Cape Girardeau County South Park, just east of highway 55 from Exit 99.
In order to understand this cache, you need a little history of the saga of the artificial frog cache.  This is the artificial frog&apos;s second home.  About 2 weeks ago, he was all set and the cache complete when the bad news came that he had been evicted for being too close to another cache.  The original site of the cache birthed the concept of the artificial frog.  A long time ago, when we were dating we liked to visit the original site and enjoy the pond there.  One evening, we spotted what we thought was an artificial frog, until he jumped into the pond.  For a couple of weeks now, froggy has been hopping around, searching for a new home suitable for a frog who likes to be near water.  Then, he found a new home at the South County Park within a few hops of the lake.  Just park in the main parking lot closest to the fishing pier and see if you can find froggy&apos;s new home.  Of course, that&apos;s only the beginning of this 2 part geocaching adventure.  Use the coordinates you find there to complete the rest of the cache:     

            37.20.XXX   and   089.35.XXX

All of the items in this cache are frog related, so have fun with this one.

Permission was granted by the Cape County Park superintendent for placement of this cache.

Redone and updated 6/29/08.  Redone 7/14/08.  It seems the replacement cache wandered off, but met a worker I knew and she returned the original cache to me, so it&apos;s now hidden at the new coordinates.  Maybe this one will stay put.

The listed coordinates are for the parking area.

The Capaha Park Rose Garden is located at the northwest corner of Capaha Park near Perryville Rd.  Cape Girardeau was once known as the City of Roses and roses stretched for over a mile between the cities of Cape Girardeau and Jackson.  A remnant of bygone days, the Rose Garden is maintained by several local garden clubs and is part of the city parks system.  Permission was granted by Dan Muser, director of the Cape Girardeau Parks and Recreation Department for placement of this cache.

There is a small parking lot adjacent to the Rose Garden and the terrain is flat, though grassy and could be handicapped accessible.  The final cache is a small lock-n-lock box.

New log book and box placed on May 16, 2009.

You will need to search for information throughout the Rose Garden to calculate the final coordinates for the cache at:

18.AB6
32.CDE

Mikado Roses
Find the year that appears on the placard for the Mikado Roses.  Use the last two digits as the values for A &amp; B.

Olympiad Roses
Find the year that appears on the placard for the Olympiad Roses.  Multiply the last two digits for the values of C &amp; D.

Cinco de Mayo Roses
Find the year that appears on the placard for these roses.  The last digit of the date is the value for E.

Cape La Croix Recreation Trail. This is Part Six of a series of
caches along the trail, numbered as placed, and NOT in any sequence
along the trail. 
The walk is all paved asphalt, with few, gentle inclines and
occasional bridges. Trail open from 6:00 a.m. ? 11:00 p.m.
The recreation trail is a very popular place when the weather is
the least bit nice. You can expect walkers, joggers and bicyclists.
Be aware of muggles as you cache along the trail.
This is a multi-stage cache. First Stage and Second Stage
are both micros. Coordinates for the second stage are in the first
stage. Second Stage contains a log and pencil. Both stages
handicapped accessible, if the individual can handle a turf
surface. 
Accuracy
Multiple sets of coordinates, from different times of different
days, with an average 12&apos; Estimated Position Error (EPE) were
averaged to give the final set listed here.
The recreation trail can be accessed from multiple points in
Cape Girardeau - time to explore! Eventually, you will be able to
geocache multiple caches, from one end to the trail to the other.

Be sure you don&apos;t miss other caches in the area.
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail
 For joggers, walkers, bicyclists, roller bladers and
skateboarders, the 4.4-mile asphalt Cape La Croix Recreation Trail
connects the Osage Community Centre on the north and Shawnee Park
Sports Complex on the south, while avoiding the need to cross city
streets. It provides users with a safe recreational experience as
it skirts the banks of the Cape La Croix Creek.
For more information on the trail, visit the 
Cape Girardeau Parks and Recreation web page.
Permission to place geocaches in Cape Girardeau Parks was
obtained from Dan Muser, Parks and Recreation Department.Additional Waypoints021403V - Go Take A Walk! Part 6 FinalN/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ Go Take A Walk!  Part 6 Final Waypoint

Cache ID: GC15X9J
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T2.5
DESC: This cache is located along a one mile hiking trail that is paved but very steep in places.
This cache was placed on 9/11 in honor of the fallen heroes on that date in 2001.  Beautiful flags were raised at the entrance to the park in honor of those who lost their lives that day.

Enjoy a hike in the North County Park along the Maple Hollow Hiking Trail.  Grab a trail guide and enjoy this one mile, at times strenuous hike.  Please note that the County Park closes at 10:00 p.m.  

The cache container is a regular sized lock-n-lock box.  A short bushwhack of less than 10 feet is required.  Twenty-two coordinates taken over 3 days and times were averaged to obtain the final coordinates.  However, with the dense tree cover, the coordinates can fluctuate.

Permission was granted to place caches in the County Parks by the County Park Superintendent.

Post Reviewer Note
2009-11-17 *gln, Greetings, 

Since you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an &quot;Owner Maintenance&quot; log on the cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don&apos;t let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!

Here are some important things to keep in mind:


    * Make sure that that your container is watertight and that the contents are free from debris.
    * Replace the container if the current one is not holding up in its environment.
    * If any of the cache contents are wet, dry them off or replace them.
    * If winter is approaching, make sure you include a pencil in your cache since pens can freeze up.
    * Check your logbook and verify that there is enough space left for signatures.
    * If your cache will not be accessible due to seasonal weather conditions, note this on the cache page.
    * Verify any travel bugs that are listed in your cache, mark those that have been listed in there for a while and aren&apos;t in the cache as &quot;missing.&quot;

2009-10-20 capegcachers, Fianlly had a chance on Sunday to get out and replace this cache.  Is now fixed in a nice new container with all new swag.  The old container really wasn&apos;t in bad shape, but somehow the log had gotten all wet, nothing else in the box was wet.  Very smelly, though.   So now all is fresh and new.

[red] DISABLING CACHE: [/red]


Greetings,

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last couple logs on this cache, it appears that this cache may be  in need of repair or at least should be checked.   Since there may  still be  a container in the  area, I can not archive it.  When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then.

Hope things get fixed up soon.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

If everything turns out to be fine you can enable this  at any time. 

[b]If I do not hear from you about fixing up this cache, I will assume that it is abandoned  and archive this cache  sometime in the future. 
[/b]


[B][RED]HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS[/B][/RED]
Respond by posting a new [b] Note[/b]. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select &quot;Post  Note&quot; as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I&apos;ll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process.

Located in southern Illinois in the Shawnee National Forest. 
We have listed two sets of questions to obtain this cache allowing for handicapped accessibility. However, for all others you can expect a 1.5:2.
This wilderness area covers over 3,300 acres of beautiful old growth forest.  320 million years ago, southern Illinois was covered by an open shallow sea, the sediment rock in this area is over 4 miles deep. This area was thrust upward out of the water and became a small mountain range, today known as the Shawnee Hills.  When the great ice sheets covered the Midwest, they extended at their largest size, just north of the Shawnee Hills.  The real magic that formed the geological oddities of The Garden of the Gods came when the glaciers melted into a cacophony of raging waterfalls, rivers, rivulets, and the like that carved some interesting rock formations that represent various objects.


One of the most unique features of the forest is the diversity of plants.  For plants and animals, it is a transition zone between north and south, east and west creating habitat for a wide range of species.  

The Observation Trail avails some of the most spectacular geological formations in the state of Illinois, the Midwest, and the country as a whole.  Large, mushroom shapes, boulders that balance and sit atop one another, weird spirals of iron inside the sandstone, magical formations and shapes that look like animals, clouds, or whatever the beholder wishes to see in them, await the geological admirer here. 
A trip during the Fall will be a real treat;  as the rock formations coming from the golden and brown highlights of the forested valley can be quite breath-taking. 

Garden of the Gods has two main trail systems.  The best known trail is the Observation Trail, which follows a 1/4 mile paved trail that leads to some spectacular overlooks of the Garden of the Gods Wilderness area and views of unusual rock formations.  This is an interpretive trail that has some interesting history about the geology of this area.  This system includes other paths that combine for about 5.5 miles and are interconnecting. 
The second main trail is the River-to-River Trail which continues for 8 miles, entering the east end of the park from High Knob then proceeding west to the Observation Trail,  south below the rock formations bearing west again to Herod.
You may want to participate in Picnicing -Hiking ? Biking ? Backpacking ? Camping -  Scenic Observation ? Bird Watching

 Requirements for Handicapped: 
1) Post a picture of themselves and their GPS at the steps of the  Handicapped Accessible parking lot sign, titled ?Tendered Through the Years?.
You are to email your answers with the name of the earthcache to the owner to the following questions 
2) What mountain range formed as Africa pushed against the east coast of North America?  
3) What was deposited here when the rivers emptied into an ancient sea?  

You may find the trail to be accessible and if so, it is highly recommended that you venture farther to view magical formations.

Requirements for Non-Handicapped: 
1)Post a picture with your GPS at your favorite rock formation along the ¼ mile trail that you must travel to answer the following questions. The trail takes about 45 minutes to walk, and questions can be answered from signs along the trail. 
You are to email your answers with the name of the earthcache to the owner to the following questions 
2) You will happen upon a very unique flat rock formation that includes a stone walkway leading to it that nearly everyone asked would give the same name, it is called ______ Rock.  
3) The dark, reddish-brown swirls and rings on these rocks were caused by rust between the rock particles;  give us one of the two names these are known by.

DESC: This cache is a 35mm film can that will require a good grip and is placed with permission!
This micro is at the Jackson Purchase Medical Center which is the home of quite a few resident canada geese.  Although the geese are residents they are not the resident evil that I named this cache after!  This resident evil that I speak of is all of the GOOSE POOP!  The geese poop all over the walking path, in the grass, and then every where else!  Luckily the grounds keepers had cleaned it up when I placed the cache.  So when you set down to play it cool and not make the mugglers think you are up to something, Don&apos;t set in the RESIDENT EVIL.  

Remember!  Use a good grip when retrieving and replacing this cache!

Cache ID: GC164YX

SIZE: Small
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: This cache will take you near the Torian Cemetery and it is #2 In my Old School Series.  Old School because back in the day they did not have ammo cans! Find this cache and you will see what I think would be the container of choice back then!  NO NIGHT CACHING!
When you arrive you will see a sign like a street sign but it has the name of the cemetery on it.  Pull of the road and park near the sign.  You will not need a 4X4 to park here my car did fine.  It is not steep at all and is grass not mud.

This cache is only near the Torian Cemetery because of the field between the cache and the cemetery.  I was playing around with Map Source and it showed this cemetery and I had been past there many times and had never noticed it.  I went to see if it was and there it was out in a field.  I asked the people at the house nearby if they owned the land it was on and they did.  I told him about Geocaching and asked if I could hide one there.  He oked it as long as we do not trample his crops.  So I went to see it and could tell that it was going to damage his crop if everyone went walking out there.  So I came back after his harvest and placed this cache.  I placed it where it can be found without going to the cemetery so that if he planted a crop that will be damaged while walking to the cemetery you can stay out of the crops and keep the land owner happy.

The cemetery itself has a very nice fence around it.  To date it has the nicest corner posts I have ever seen.  There is one of these post at each corner and one on each side of the entrance gate.  The gate will not open but if you go to the north west corner you can walk in where a tree has pushed the fence away from the corner post a bit!   Please take the time to explore the cemetery if you can.  

Due to the nature of the old school container I beg of you to rehide it as good or better than you found it. While checking on my own caches I have noticed how rehiding the container is done poorly which can lead to mugglings.
Remember to be respectful and that there is NO NIGHT CACHING PLEASE!

This area of some 143 acres was inhabited by prehistoric people throughout three different archeological periods, totaling at least 2,500 years.  The oldest, the Archaic period, was from 3000-4000 B.C.  This was followed by inhabitants of the Woodland period which extended from perhaps 500 to 600 B.C. until 900 A.D.  This third people who lived in the area are referred to by archaeologists as agriculturists, and lived at the location from approximately 1000 A.D. until 1500 A.D.  The south fork of the Saline River was the location of thousands of deer, buffalo and antelope.  The animals were attracted to the site by their need for salt, which was brought to the surface by multiple springs.  Simply by licking the mud banks along the river the need for salt could be met.  Tall grass and an abundant water supply made the area an animal paradise.  The animals provided food, tools, and clothing for civilization after civilization.  The Indian cherished the location where a plentiful supply of food salt and other necessities could be secured.  The site was also enhanced by its location next to a 900 acre glacial lake.  Excellent preservation conditions thus permitted the recovery of a wide assortment of artifacts leading to new insights into Middle Archaic life in southern Illinois.  Tools fashioned from stone and animal bones provided information about technology employed between 4000-3000 B.C.  Plant residue and animal remains provided information about diet and food preparation. Two salt springs in Gallatin County produced brine for one of the earliest salt works west of the Alleghenies. 

The recovery of more than 100 skeletons gave new insights on diseases and injuries of the Middle Archaic people.  
Methods of burial furnish important information as to how the society of the period was organized.

The saline formations are actually saltwater mixed with sandstone called Mount Simon layers.  The saltwater in the Mount Simon sandstone is three times as salty as you find in the ocean. It has no economical use. This sandstone layer can be as thick as 1,000 to 1,200 feet. 


Within this same county but on private land and posted as No Trespassing were more prevalent sources of salt, found in springs along the Saline River.  For people whose diet consists primarily of vegetables, salt is an important mineral to maintain basic health.  Salt was also an essential ingredient for tanning hides.  Hides, and particularly deer hides, were used as currency by pioneers and frontiersmen.  In this culture, there were doe skins and buck skins which eventually gave us the term ?buck? in our present monetary system.  These springs were so important that they supplied salt for much of the Midwest and were a topic of discussion in planning policy in the national government.  It has been said that the tax from the sale of the salt sustained the early Illinois government to the point that it may not have survived without it.

Located in southern Illinois along the Ohio River in Hardin County, and is even accessible from Kentucky side of the river via ferry. 
We have listed two sets of questions to obtain this cache allowing for handicap accessibility. However, for all others you can expect a 1:2 as even on the trail you must be cautious in some areas to find your answers.
Few natural formations are as awe-inspiring or intriguing as a cave.  The deep, dark recesses immediately conjure up images of adventure, mystery, terror, robbers and pirates.  
At Cave-In-Rock you can experience this fascination for yourself.  Sitting atop the high bluffs overlooking the scenic Ohio River the heavily wooded park is named for the cave that was carved out of the limestone rock by water thousands of years ago.  
Throughout the 19th century, this remarkable geological feature was an important landmark, prominently displayed on maps from the period.

This karst cavern in the Mississippian St. Louis Limestone once extended farther to the south, but the swirling waters of the Ohio River, just a few feet to the south of the entrance, have truncated it.  The Cave-In-Rock was worn into the sandstone bluffs of the Ohio by river floods, especially during the melt off following the Wisconsin ice age.  It is not a cavern like Mammoth Cave in nearby Kentucky;  it is a wide tunnel leading a short distance.  

Karst topography is a landscape shaped by the dissolution of a soluble layer or layers of bedrock, usually carbonate rock such as limestone or dolomite.  These landscapes display distinctive surface features and underground drainages, and in some examples there may be little or no surface drainage.  Some areas of karst topography, such as southern Missouri and northern Arkansas in the USA, are underlain by thousands of caves.



Modern history says this cave has been a landmark for almost 300 years and has been a church, tavern, home and now tourist attractions. Today trails wind along the riverbank offering views of riverboats, barges and other river scenes.

Early on as European explorers traveled this way it was a conspicuous curiosity frequently mentioned in diaries and journals. In 1729 the first European explorer to encounter it was M. de Lery of France who called it ?caverne dans Le Roc?.  The cave also served as a great lair for outlaws, bandits and river pirates who preyed on the people traveling along the Ohio River.  For example, in 1797 it was converted into a tavern, offering an opportunity for the owner to dispatch his cohorts/henchmen upriver to do what pirates do best. Various such desperadoes took advantage of the secrecy and seclusion afforded by Cave-In-Rock until westward expansion of civilization and commerce had destroyed or driven out the ?river rats? and the cave began to serve as temporary shelter for other pioneers on their way west. 
 
It?s interesting to note that the cave served as a backdrop for a scene in the movie ?How The West Was Won.?  The scene was a near-accurate portrayal of how, in the 18th-19th centuries, ruthless bandits used the cave to lure unsuspecting travelers to an untimely end.

Available here is boating, camping, hiking, picnicking, lodge, restaurant, and a marina.

Requirements for Handicapped: 
1)	Log a picture with your GPS at the listed coordinates.

3)	In the back look at the ceiling, what geological feature you see?
4)	While visiting the entrance of the cave, how wide do you estimate the width?

 During times of extreme high water All cachers are allowed to log using the questions of the Handicapped Accessible cachers if the entrance is unaccessible.

This cache is a replacement of a somewhat negelected cache. I hated to see this area without a maintained cache, it is to beautiful not to share.

Those who have logged the old cache have a new reason to come back and enjoy the lake. There are wonderful sunsets here, so find you a seat along the shore or out on the gazebo on the pier and relax.

There is also some good food establishments across the road in Grand Rivers.

Post Reviewer Note
2009-03-14 *gln, Greetings,

I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs.

I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache.
[b]
If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.
[/b] 

From the guidelines...       http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint      &quot;... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem.  This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b]  normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive  the listing.&quot;  

If your  cache does get archived all is not lost. When it gets repaired we  can get it activated again if it still meets the listing guidelines. 

Thanks for your understanding.

[B][RED]HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS[/B][/RED]

Welcome to Hagy Cemetery, the second of the Stoddard County Cemetery Cache series.  Please be respectful of the grounds.  Coordinates listed take you to stage 1.  There, meet W.L. and Ella, my grandparents.  Solve the final coordinates by answering these questions:

What year did Ella pass away (last 2 numbers)?  Subtract 2 to solve for AB.

What day of the month did W.L. pass away?  Answer equals C.

Subtract the year W.L. was born from the year Ella was born.  Answer equals D.

Final coordinates are at:

N36 48.6AB
W089 57.CDD (DD = same digit repeated)

Please place the cache back as you found it, to discourage muggling.  The road through the cemetery is busier than it looks.

I can not tell you about the combo because the place I work at in Murray, KY has a name and I can not mention it in this listing.  I assume I can tell you that I make things that go in the outside wall of your house that you can see through.  These things were first made by that company I work for in _____, Iowa.  The other half of the combo cannot be mentioned either but I did get permission to place this cache from them!  I will say that it is where we send them before you can get them.  All of that aside, I guess I can call it the &quot;Don&apos;t Step in the Poop Series&quot;  because it is near where the Mennonites tie up their horses before they go shopping for some unmentionables.  Anyway!  Hope you enjoy the cache!

D4.0/T1.0
DESC: GO TAKE A WALK! and do a series of geocaches along Cape Girardeau&apos;s
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail. This is Part Seven of a series of
caches along the trail, numbered as placed, and NOT in any sequence
along the trail. 
The walk is all paved asphalt, with few, gentle inclines and
occasional bridges. Trail open from 6:00 a.m. ? 11:00 p.m.
This cache is handicapped accessible.
The recreation trail is a very popular place when the weather is
the least bit nice. You can expect walkers, joggers and bicyclists.
Be aware of muggles as you cache along the trail. 
This is a nano;  maybe not an evil nano, but certainly a nasty
little nano. The keen-eyed geocacher may tumble to it&apos;s placement
fairly quickly. It contains a log only;  BYOP (Bring Your Own Pen).
If you get frustrated with it, drop me an e-mail and I&apos;ll see if I
can nudge you in the right direction. It can be done from the trail
and is handicapped accessible.
The recreation trail can be accessed from multiple points in
Cape Girardeau - time to explore! 
Be sure you don&apos;t miss other caches in the area.
Handicaching Information
There is a small gravel parking lot nearby. Located just north of
Arena Park. See coordinates for parking. The cache is available
without leaving the trail.
Accuracy
35 sets of coordinates, with 7-8&apos; EPE, were averaged to give the
final set listed here.
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail
 For joggers, walkers, bicyclists, rollerbladers and skateboarders,
the 4.4-mile asphalt Cape La Croix Recreation Trail connects the
Osage Community Centre on the north and Shawnee Park Sports Complex
on the south, while avoiding the need to cross city streets. It
provides users with a safe recreational experience as it skirts the
banks of the Cape La Croix Creek.
For more information on the trail, visit the 
Cape Girardeau Parks and Recreation web page.
Permission to place geocaches in Cape Girardeau Parks was
obtained from Dan Muser, Parks and Recreation Department.

DESC: You will be taken to a small park which splits the road!  The cache WILL require STEALTH!
The parking for this park is at the south of the park and across the road from the farmers market.  As you walk through the park to the cache you will notice a fountain which was placed by the National Human alliance in 1911.  It appears to have a few small basins for pets to get a drink from.  Next you will come to a stage area which has a monument dedicated to the veterans of World War II.  Each of the four sides is dedicated to one of the four branches of the U.S. Military.  Just past the cache location there is a tombstone type marker which reads &quot;Jefferson Davis Highway U.D.C. 1935.  The Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway was a transcontinental highway in the United States from Washington, D.C. west to San Diego, California. It was named for Jefferson Davis (1808-1889). He was an American soldier, U.S. Congressman, and Secretary of War in the cabinet of U.S. President Franklin Pierce. He is best known as the first and only president of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War (1861-1865).  There is also a Kentucky Historical marker #654 which reads...  Two Successful Raids  CSA General Nathan B. Forrest with main body of cavalry passed through Mayfield to and from destructive raid on Paducah, March 25, 1864. Gen. Abraham Buford&apos;s division camped here. Kentucky regiments given leave to visit homes, enlist recruits. All returned. News item led Forrest to send Buford from Tenn. through here again, April 14, to capture horses missed before.  Last but not least, just across the street from the cache location there is a set of three flag poles which were placed in memory of all of the veterans of the U.S.A.  Enjoy all of the history and bring a picnic lunch if you like because there are picnic tables there as well!

 <desc>Wickliffe Mounds by Titansfan
Cache ID: GC16KYX
Earthcache
SIZE: Not chosen
D2.0/T1.5
DESC: The town of Wickliffe Mounds was both a ceremonial and
adminstrative center of an important chiefdom in the ancient Native
American culture.



,
At its peak it had a population probably reaching into the
hundreds. It was apparently inhabited hundreds of years ago. The
site is dominated by two large platforms mounds, with several other
smaller mounds scattered around the area around the area around a
central plaza. Their agriculture was based on corn as a staple, and
they had trade with societies as far away as North Carolina,
Wisconsin, and the Gulf of Mexico. The community of Wickliffe had a
social hierarchy ruled by a hereditary chief.

 Mounds rebuilding episodes are construed as rituals of burial and
renewal, while the four-sided construction acts to replicate the
flat earth and the four quarters of the earth. 
The mounds were constructed in about 200 years with the Native
Americans hauling the dirt in buckets. The mounds did make the
bluff appear higher. 
In the archaeology of the United States and Canada, the term
&quot;mound&quot; has specific and technical connotations. In this sense, a
mound is a deliberately constructed elevated earthen structure or
earthwork, intended for a range of potential uses. In European and
Asian archaeology, the word tumulus may be used as a synonym for
artificial hills, particularly if they are related to particular
burial customs.
While the term &quot;mound&quot; may be applied to historic constructions,
most mounds in the United States are prehistoric earthworks, built
by Native American peoples. Native Americans built a variety of
mounds, including flat-topped pyramids or cones known as platform
mounds, rounded cones, and ridge or loaf-shaped mounds. Some mounds
took on unusual shapes, such as the outline of cosmologically
significant animals. These are known as effigy mounds. Some mounds,
such as a few in Wisconsin, have rock formations, or petroforms
within them, on them, or near them.
While these mounds are perhaps not as famous as burial mounds,
like their European analogs, Native American mounds also have a
variety of other uses. While some prehistoric cultures, like the
Adena culture, used mounds preferentially for burial, others used
mounds for other ritual and sacred acts, as well as for secular
functions. The platform mounds of the Mississippian culture, for
example, may have supported temples, the houses of chiefs, council
houses, and may have also acted as a platform for public speaking.
Other mounds would have been part of defensive walls to protect a
certain area. The Hopewell culture used mounds as markers of
complex astronomical alignments related to ceremonies.
Mounds and related earthworks are the only significant
monumental construction in prehistoric Eastern and Central North
America.
A mound is a general term for an artificial heaped pile of
earth, gravel, sand, rocks, or debris. The most common use is in
reference to natural earthen formation such as hills and mountains,
particularly if they appear artificial. The term may also be
applied to any rounded area of topographically higher elevation on
any surface. Artificial mounds have been created for a variety of
reasons throughout history, including ceremonial (platform mound),
burial (tumulus), and commemorative purposes (e.g. Kosciuszko
Mound).
1) What is the name of the ancient culture that inhabited the
area?
2) What years were the areas inhabited by the ancient
culture?
3) How many Mounds are located within the park?
4) In your opininon how much higher are the mounds than the
bluff?
5) Post a picture, onto the cache page, of you and/or group with
GPSr at the ceremonial mound.
The site is located at the Wickliffe Historical State Site.
Access to the earthcache is only permitted with the park is
open.
May 1 to Sept 21: every day 9 to 4:30 pm.
Dec. to Feb: Monday to Friday, 9 to 4:30 pm.
Oct. and Nov: Tuesday to Saturday 9 to 4:30 pm.
The park is closed on Federal and State holidays.
The park does host many mounds that include a ceremonial mound
and museums of ancient Native American life.

This was our first-ever find in Kentucky. We’ve seen the mounds up by St. Louis, but we didn’t realize how far the mound-building cultures extended. We were on a very tight schedule, so we didn’t have time to tour through the museum, but we did stop and talk to the staff, and picked up some brochures to learn more about the site. We’ve already decided we need to tour down in this direction at a more leisurely pace!

This cache is placed because of the scene where Everett and Delmar are watching a movie and Pete is brought in to see the movie while he is chained to other convicts in a chain gang.  Pete sees that his two friends are there and tells them &quot;Do not seek the treasure, It&apos;s bushwhacked&quot; I guess you could say that, like the &quot;treasure&quot;, this cache is bushwhacked.  BECAUSE OF THIS IF YOU DO NOT SIGN THE LOG I WILL DELETE YOUR LOG FROM THE LISTING.  Please rehide the cache as found for the next finder and to keep it from being muggled!

Rattlesnake Ferry, Years ago there was a ferry across the river but nothing left but some poles sticking out of the bank. The cache is up on a hill just before the river because it will flood sometimes during the spring. Follow the road and when you get close to the river there is a right turn and just 20ft after you will see a small trail that goes up the hill, which you should hike unless you have 4 wheel drive.
The cache is a small Lock n Lock box painted to match the surroundings;  it contains some trinkets and a logbook. You might want to have a good GPSr cause the tree cover will play havoc with keeping a lock.   Happy Caching.

I didn&apos;t realize there was another deer season going on this weekend.  There were guys in orange hats everywhere on the main road leading in.  I didn&apos;t see any hunters in the vicinity of the cache, though, so I took a chance and just made a lot of noise that only a person would make.

DESC: Three stage multi, handicap accessible.
Another in the Stoddard County Cemetary Cache (SCCC) series.  Four of Jenn&apos;s great-grandparents are buried here.  Come visit them.  Placed this cache on the day we hit 100 finds!

Coordinates take you to the first stage.  Visit with Samuel and Stella.

To find the second stage, solve the following:

AB = What year did Stella pass away (last 2 digits)?
CD = Samuel&apos;s age when he passed away?
EF = AB - 5

N36 57.0AB
W090 0C.DEF

Coordinates take you to the second stage.  There, visit with Robert and Mary.

To find the third stage, solve the following:

AB = the year Mary passed away (last two digits) minus 5
C = day Robert was born minus day Mary was born multiplied by 3
D = month Robert was born minus month Mary was born
E = day Mary was born

N36 57.0AB
W090 0C.DEC

This will take you to the third stage, where the micro is located.  You are looking for a camo&apos;d match tube.  The third hint should get you there if the coords don&apos;t.

Congratulations to Satchamo 44 for FTF!

Additional Waypoints
Hint: #1: Tool time.
#2: Little people, in both sides of the street.
#3: Right back where you started, above eye level.  You may need an assist to reach it.

DESC: This is one cache in a series of caches I will place.  Each of these caches will have something to do with a scene in the movie Oh Brother Where Art Thou.
This cache is placed because of the scene where Delmar, Pete, Everett, &amp; Tommy become The Soggy Bottom Boys by singing ?Man of Constant Sorrows? into the yonder can and skedaddling.  When they finish singing the blind man that runs the radio station says ?Ooh wee that was some mighty fine singing? and as he hits the glass on the recording studio with a clip board he tells them ?com on in here and sign these papers and I will give you $10.00 a piece!?  Little did they know it would become a hit!  Later in the same radio station another gentleman ask the blind guy if he knows where he can find The Soggy Bottom Boys and the blind man replies?  ?Ya Ya Ya They sang into the yonder can and skedaddled?.  He then informs the blind man that the song is a hit, they are playing it as far away as Mobile, that ?the whole state is going apie?, and that they need to ?sign them boys to a big fat contract? before the competition does. 

I placed this cache with permission.  When you get near the cords you can park in the small parking lot near the satellite dish.  The land owners ask that you keep your hunting between the parking lot and the cache.  The cache is not near the building or behind it!  Thanks

It was not bad going in but coming out was a bitch.  A brier bush got a hold on my arm and just would not let go.  If this happened on the way in I could have signed in blood.  Oh well that caching!!!!  Very fun hide....  Nice cool place for a nap!!!!

DESC: A quick and easy multi, just two miles off I55. Both stages of the
cache are handicapped accessible if you can handle level turf.
There is paved parking, without curbs, just off the first stage
area. Total distance is under .25 miles and should take well under
an hour to complete.
The cache is NOT at the coordinates above. These will take
you to the first stage, where you will find a memorial to Army
National Guard soldiers of Charlie Company, 1140th Engineer
Battalion. Use the names of the soldiers to find the final stage of
this cache. The final is a micro containing a log and pencil 
Final Stage Coordinates: N36 53.ABC W089

get a kick out of the M-60A Battle Tank, an F4 Phantom Jet Fighter,
a M101A1, 105mm Light Howitzer from WWII, a U.S. Navy 1955 Sioux

My apologies for the delay in logging and the copy-paste. I got way behind and need to catch up.
Found it
2009-10-25 Indigo500, When I was mapping out the route for the road trip for Applesauce and me, I really wanted to come through Sikeston.  I hadn&apos;t been here since around 1999, when my great aunt passes away after living her entire life here in Sikeston.  My dad was born here.  His mom lived in Buckeye....ever heard of that?  She married my grandpa in Cape Girardeau and after their two kids were born, they moved out of Sikestone to KS City, MO, then to New Jersey, and eventually they settled in Indianapolis, where I was raised and still live.  I hadn&apos;t been back here since my great aunt&apos;s funeral.  Her house was in terrible disrepair at that time.  I couldn&apos;t believe the change in the house.  It&apos;s been totally re-done and is now a counseling office.  We took videos to show my aunt and cousin in Texas.  But enough about me.....
I loved the concept of this multi.  We both hopped out and counted and made notes. Then we were off to stage 2 for the find.  tftc  sl

2009-10-25 Indigo500, When I was planning the route for a road trip for Applesauce and me, I really wanted to come through Sikeston.  My great grandparents lived here, and my dad was born here in 1928.  His folks didn&apos;t stay here, but ended up in Indianapolis where I was raised.  We came back to visit my great grandma, and then later...my great aunt,who passed away in her 90&apos;s in 1999 (I think).  I hadn&apos;t been back here since her funeral.  Her house was in major disrepair, and Applesauce and I cruised it and WOW, it&apos;s been totally redone and is lovely.  We took videos to show my aunt and cousin in Texas.  But enough about me.....
I really enjoyed the concept of this puzzle cache.  We counted and took notes and took pics of the tank and plane and anchor, etc and found the cache!  Thanks for the fun.  TFTC  SL

DESC: This is one cache in a series of caches I will place.  Each of these caches will have something to do with a scene in the movie Oh Brother Where Art Thou.
WHEN YOU ARIVE AT THE CACHE YOU WILL NEED TO PARK JUST OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THERE IS A NICE FLAT SPOT AT N 36* 46.799  W 088* 28.005.  If you park here be careful as you navigate to the cache because this road has alot of traffic.  

This cache is placed because of the scene where Pete hears the voices of some women singing &quot;Go to sleep little baby...&quot;  He asks that Everett stop the car and when he does Peter runs down to the creek where he sees the women.  He quickly says &quot;I seen em first!&quot;  The girls come over to the boys and each of the three girls picks one of the boys to try to seduce.  Some time passes and Delmar wakes up to see that Everett is there but Pete is gone and only Pete&apos;s cloths remain.  He wakes up Everett and sees what he thinks is Pete&apos;s heart in the shirt that is laying on the rocks.  As the heart beats it moves and when it emerges from the shirt it is really a toad which Delmar thinks is Pete and that the women had turned him into the toad and he proceeds to catch Pete before he gets away!

This type of cache is beginning to rival caches hidden in stumps for caches I end up having to DNF that others find with ease.  I shouldn&apos;t have been nervous about looking for this one, as I&apos;m pretty sure I know at least one &quot;warden&quot; from each level of city, county, and state.  This is the first time I&apos;ve driven on the bypass.  Thanks for bringing me here, I&apos;ll give it another look the next time I&apos;m in the area.

is placed on old railroad lane that has had the tracks removed and
has been sold back to the orginal owners family. Permission has
been obtained to place this cache here. If you need to talk to
anyone about hide, talk to Bill Gregory who lives at the top of the
hill on the left,one half mile from the hide as you come from
Mexico.

Found it
2009-08-16 Siap, We found this one on the way to the grandparents house. An older lady drove by whilst I was on said plank, and while my powers of stealth are above average, there was not much hiding, short of jumping off the plank. So I just gave her a polite wave......each time she turned around and drove by,......slowly. My wife was waiting for me in the car and when she saw I was done she swung around to pick me up. The lady followed us until we turned back around. I like to think she was just concerned for her fellow man and wanted to help. Probably more like she was Gladys Kravitz incarnate. TFTH

SIZE: Micro
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: You are looking for a small camo bottle.  Parking is close by and you will have to travel over a bit of grass and lawn to reach the cache.
Pay a visit to the Bloomfield City Park, home of two log cabins built in 1833 by Morton Barnett in what was the swampland near Clines Island. These rare and well-preserved survivors of pioneer days were moved in 1972 to the park for public display. Built of hand-hewn poplar logs, one stands two stories high with a dog run through the center. The second log cabin is a one-story structure. 

The cache is located on the larger of the two cabins.  Coordinates will take you to the entryway of the cabin.  The cache should be easy to find after a bit of looking around.

Congratulations to ricstone for FTF!

Instead a continued forward to my intended target. I approach it from one side, looked up and down, nothing.  I approached from the other side, looked up and down NOTHING!  Musing to myself aloud &quot;what does the CO mean by a &quot;Under a not so grounded stick?&quot; Then as I looked up the path out there it was in its hiding spot saying &quot;what took you so long, I been here waiting all this time.&quot;  In less than two days I have now conquerred two caches that have been a thorn in my behind.

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D3.0/T3.0
DESC: Park on Bowman Bottoms rd. Trail head is at N 37 30.107
W 088 53.315 and goes to the west. Path makes the cache farther but easier to get to(not as many briers and no ledges to climb down). Path to the cache and Bulge Hole  turns right (north) at N 37 30.095 W 088 53.657 ( path continues west but you need to turn to the north at above mentioned coordinates).
The cache is found in rock formation called Bulge Hole. Bulge Hole is a fairly large cliff overhang that usually has a water fall.In fact at times several waterfalls are present if your willing to explore a little! The cache is in a clear lock container. We placed the cache away from main attraction so every passer-by would not find it, but will still be under the overhang, covered with sticks and rocks. After you find the cache, be sure to walk to the back end of the canyon (south) to see the main attraction. 

Contents:
Log sheet
hot hand
bracelet
deer pic
spike cross
two clips
other assortments of trinkets
Hint: under overhang on east side covered with rocks. small log to help mark.

2009-07-06 KroBro, Been traveling the state for the last week catching up on the DeLorme challenge. The whole time I couldn&apos;t get back down here in Shawnee. So on the way to the campground I had to grab a cache that requires a little time.

So I hit the recommended parking and followed the trail. Signs of a lot of rain was apparent. So get to the point where I&apos;m suppose to follow north. Well I did so but lost the trail. Luckily the floor was pretty open which allowed me to correct myself. I hit the utility cut and thought I&apos;d see where that would get me. Nowhere...too steep to climb does the bluff. 

So back I went into the woods hoping to pick up that trail. Finally did and took me there, but in a roundabout way. Guess that&apos;s the only way unless. getting brave. Hit GZ and just sat and grabbed some water. Searched and found the cache soon. Signed in and relaxed in the shade, It was nice as I was soaked. Headed back the way I came and no probs. Thanks for the fun hike.

2009-06-18 Illini4, Amazing Place! Hard hike in, but well worth it. We tried to drive down the narrow muddy road, but soon backed back out - too soft for truck. Decided to walk in. Little path to right was overgrown and ended too soon. Ended up in powerline mowed area and came in just above bulge hole. The cache was off the coordinates quite a bit, but we found it. Took a screwdriver and left a keychain. Walked the powerline area back to mud road. TFTC!

2009-05-02 catdad, After all the recent rain there was water falls everywhere. Of course my camera is at the house, so no new pictures. After finding the cache I explored the area and ended up walking the power line trail out. I was rewarded with seeing some wild turkeys. I spotted them before they saw me, so I was able to watch them for a while.

Got to this one thanks to CO&apos;s navigation skills with a good ol&apos; atlas!  When I first grabbed this one, I touched a spider that scurried back into an attached web nest thingy, very gross!  Otherwise, very nice place for a cache.

DESC: 
Illinois Lowest Geographical Point


Illinois lowest point occurs at the southernmost point in the
state of Illinois at the Mississippi river (pictured
above).
The coordinate listed is located in Fort Defiance State
Park at the point of land between the Ohio and Mississippi
Rivers.
One of five physiographic divisions of Illinois, the Gulf
Coastal Plain at the southern tip of Illinois is an extremely flat
area where the land has been built of alluvial deposits from the
Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Much of the region is cultivated and
is very productive. Because of the fertile soils and the great
river there, early settlers in this section of Illinois gave the
region the nickname Little Egypt.
At the southernmost tip of this land is the lowest point in the
state of Illinois at 279 feet msl.
Conversely, the highest point in the state occurs at
Charles Mound, a gentle 1,235-foot msl hill in northern Jo Daviess
County, near the small town of Scales Mound and 11 miles northeast
of Galena in extreme northwestern Illinois.
Parking is available within 300 feet of the low point
and is fully ADA accessible.


 
This point, like any location close to rivers, is prone to
flooding. There is no need to leave the riverbank to log this
earthcache!
Information concerning river levels and trends can be
found HERE:

Do NOT enter moving water! &apos;As close as you can get&apos; is

The Mississippi River is the second longest river in the United
States, with a length of 2,320 mi.
The Ohio River is the largest tributary by volume of the
Mississippi River. It is approximately 981 miles long.
Highest Point in Illinois: Charles Mound at 1,235
feet.
Lowest Point in Illinois: Mississippi River at 279
feet
The coordinates will take you to the &apos;point&apos; at Fort Defiance
where the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers join.
 
To log this EC, post a picture of yourself and your GPSr at the
bronze information plaque pictured on this page and include the
coordinates.

the answers to the following three questions:
1. What is the elevation of the Illinois low point?
2. What is the name of the physiographic region where the low
point occurs?
3. Standing at the lowest point available (depending on river

And only four hours to go before I sleep.  Nice place!

The Meeting of The Rivers




 
The Confluence of these two great rivers occurs at the
southernmost point in the state of Illinois at Fort Defiance State
Park. This point, like any location close to rivers, is prone to
flooding. It is not necessary to leave the riverbank to log this
cache!
A plaque located in Fort Defiance State Park has a very
good explanation of this location, as follows:
 
Long known to the Indians who used the two great rivers
as highways for trade and war, this junction of the Ohio and
Mississippi was first sighted by Europeans when Marquette and
Joliet glided past in 1673. Ten years later La Salle explored the
area and established France?s claim to the Mississippi valley. From
that time on this confluence was recognized as a strategic site for
settlement and fortification. George Rogers Clark, following the
capture of Kaskaskia in 1778, stationed armed boats at this
junction to guard against attacks on the Illinois country by the
British or Spanish. Here in 1811 the ?New Orleans?, first steamboat
to navigate western waters, lay at anchor during three nights of
the New Madrid earthquake. In April of 1861 Fort Defiance was
established at the confluence to thwart Confederate invasion and
blockade the trade of the South. From here was launched General
Grant?s great flanking movement up the Cumberland and Tennessee
Rivers, which began at Fort Henry and ended at Vicksburg, giving
the Union complete control of the Mississippi.

River Levels


 

Do NOT enter moving water! &apos;As close as you can get&apos; is
still an interesting and qualifying photo! No matter how high the
water, the two rivers WILL meet!


 
The Mississippi River is the second longest river in the
United States, with a length of 2,320 mi from its source in Lake
Itasca in Minnesota to its mouth in Gulf of Mexico. From its
source, the river falls 1,475 feet until it empties into the Gulf
of Mexico.
The Ohio River is the largest tributary, by volume, of
the Mississippi River. It is approximately 981 miles long and is
formed by the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at
Point State Park in Pittsburgh, PA. The Ohio River falls 440 feet
along it&apos;s route to the confluence at Cairo, IL.
The coordinates will bring you to the &apos;point&apos; at Fort
Defiance where the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers join.
Parking is available within 300 feet of the point. It&apos;s a flat,
easy walk. The park area is fully ADA accessible.


To log this EC, post a picture of yourself and your GPSr at

2009-12-21 CyclonicKWF, The month and year are winding down and in need of a cache for December I took sometime from my Holiday break to grab some caches.  Since we had been visiting my wife&apos;s family in Calvert City I figured this would be a great time to hit some of the caches in Northern Land Between the Lakes.  

My first stop was the Livingston Bike and Hiking trail.  I had been back here before when I got all of Pirate&apos;s Hurricane caches.  This place looks very different after the ice storm.  The trek into the woods proved to be more of a challenge with all of the downed branches.  I found the boot without much problem, but I was thinking the cache was in it.  Fearing the cache was gone I reread the description and quickly discovered the cache.  I signed the log, replaced the cache, and headed on my way.  

I had brought a travel bug to put in this cache because I was certain that this would be a bigger container because of the location.  

Thanks for the cache.

 <desc>Buffalo Bluff by GEO.JOE
Cache ID: GC1A59Q
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T3.0
DESC: This cache will hopefully give you the chance to really experience
this valley. From the parking spot you will walk in along Cedar
Creek and below the bluffs, search for Native American Rock Art at
Buffalo Rock, Explore some rock shelters to see some petrified wood
then climb out of the valley to take a stroll along the mixed moss
covered bluff top, be sure to find a place to sit and soak in the
sights and sounds of this great place.
Parking for Buffalo Rock is at (N37 29.799 W88 45.536), the trail
leads out of the back of the parking area. Follow the trail just
over 1/3 of a mile to Buffalo Rock (N37 30.074 W88 45.680) 
&quot;The Buffalo Rock site consists of an ocher buffalo painting on the
wall of rock shelter. Shelter is adjacent to the old
Golconda-Kaskaskia Trail that once connected the Ohio and
Mississippi Rivers. Painting may have historic Native American
(post-1673) origin. Although it could be earlier, as buffalo are
believed to have first crossed the Mississippi River into southern
Illinois around 1450.&quot; 

Rock art can be very difficult to see due to the vegetation growth
in Southern Illinois. There are only 60 known rock art sites in
Illinois as compared to over 300 in Missouri. In the past few years
seven small, faint, rust colored paintings have been discovered
under the rock shelter to the right of Buffalo Rock. The other
paintings include a small crescent-shaped moon and an equal-arm
cross. Please remember that the rock art in the area has survived
for 300 to 1000 years, please do not touch or disturb it in any
way. 

After seeing Buffalo Rock you have a decision to make on how you
want to precede to reach the cache. The easiest way to the top of
the bluff is to head toward N37 30.051 W088 45.661 from Buffalo
Rock. Then follow the top of the bluff to the cache. 
If you are feeling a little more adventurous you can continue below
the bluff about 300 feet north of the painted buffalo to search for
petrified wood in the roof of a rock shelter, look for the rock
layer with lots of pebbles in it. Continue north below the bluff
until the creek blocks you and there you will find a little more
adventurous climb out of the valley to a ledge, you then walk south
along the ledge to reach the top of the bluff and then on to the
cache. (I made it so it isn&apos;t too scary, If the rock is wet do not
climb out this way the rock will be slick) 

After you find the cache remember there is a whole other side of
the valley. Across the creek there are many large boulders that
have passages between, the boulders and between the boulders and
the bluff, they are a great place to explore. There are also three
more caches north along Cedar Creek: Arch cache, For My Sweetheart
and Cedar Creek cache. They can be reached by a 3 mile hike (6 mile
round trip) from the parking area for Buffalo Rock. There will be 3
to 6 creek crossings. From the cache you can continue north along
the top of the bluff to the large rock fall, waterfall for the next
spot to get back into the valley and to the trail to the other
caches. Primitive camping is allowed at the parking coordinates,
backcountry camping is allowed throughout Shawnee National Forest,

2009-12-14 racer2814, Found during the first day of a 2 day drive through southern IL and MO. Working on 3 different Challenge Caches. Enjoyed some peaceful relaxing caches. Orale! Live, laugh, love, cache.

A fantastic area. Picked up the geocoin that&apos;s been here for a year.
Found it
2009-07-08 KroBro, Had a nice trek to the bluff area, swatting away the webs. Headed up and a lite bw to gz. Found easily. The whole trip is very scenic. Didn&apos;t catch the paintings though. Maybe I was looking for something else. When I got back to parking a bunch of guys were gearing up to ride the trail on bikes. That must be tough. Thanks GJ for another quality hide.

2008-05-16 B&amp;TLand, I can never get tired of this area! 

Thanks Joe for bringing us here again, and maintaining a way for others to find out about this area. 

Watching you have to almost fight the big chicken over it&apos;s roosting area was almost commical. 

I look forward to visiting this area again soon!
Found it
2008-05-16 regnad, Spent the weekend camping at Lake Glendale with some fellow RVG members.  I can&apos;t believe that it has taken me this long to come up here and explore the area.  Just about everywhere we went, there was something spectacular to see.

Take for instance this cache:  I had heard about this spot a few years ago and the view did not disappoint. I have been wanting to see the Buffalo art for some time and I&apos;m glad that I finally got the chance to find it.

It looks like this might be a popular place to camp as well.  We passed at least five spots where people had hiked in tents and coolers and set up for what looked like an exciting weekend away from the &quot;modern&quot; world.

The New Madrid Earthquake

 
An earthquake is the result of a sudden release of
energy in the Earth&apos;s crust that creates seismic waves.
The New Madrid Earthquake, the largest earthquake ever
recorded in the contiguous United States, centered near here on
February 7, 1812. It got its name from its primary location in the
New Madrid Seismic Zone, near New Madrid, Missouri.
This earthquake was preceded by three other major quakes: two on
December 16, 1811, and one on January 23, 1812. These earthquakes
destroyed approximately half the town of New Madrid. There were
also numerous aftershocks in the area for the rest of that
winter.
There are estimates that the earthquakes were felt strongly over
50,000 square miles, and moderately across nearly one million
square miles.
Some sections of the Mississippi River appeared to run backwards
for a short time. Church bells were reported to ring in Boston,
Massachusetts and sidewalks were reported to have been cracked and
broken in Washington, D.C.
As a result of the quakes, large areas sank into the earth, new
lakes were formed (notably Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee), and the
Mississippi River changed its course, creating numerous
geographic exclaves, including Madrid Bend, along the
state boundaries defined by the river. Many houses were thrown
down, but fatalities and damage were low, because the area was
sparsely settled.
Geology


 
750 million years ago
The New Madrid Seismic Zone is made up of reactivated
faults that formed when North America began to split or rift apart
during the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the
Neoproterozoic Era. The rift failed but remained as a scar or zone
of weakness. The area was then flooded by an ancient ocean,
depositing layers of sediment on the rift.
200 million years ago
Geological structure of Reelfoot Rift During the Mesozoic
Era. As the Atlantic Ocean was opening in the east, rifting was
once again re-activated and intrusive igneous rocks were emplaced.
But again the rifting failed and the continent remained intact,
although with a significant zone of weakness.
This rift is known as the Reelfoot Rift and coincides with the
northernmost portion of the Mississippi embayment where the
Madrid Bend now exists.
Modern seismic activity

 
Since the 1970s, thousands of earthquakes have been recorded
in the New Madrid seismic zone.
Most of the seismicity is located from 3 to 15 mi beneath the
Earth&apos;s surface.
Probability of future earthquakes


 
The probability of magnitude 6.0 or greater in the near future
is considered significant. A 90% chance of such an earthquake by
2040 has been given. The odds of another 8.0 event within 50
years are estimated to be between 7 and 10 percent.
Because of the unconsolidated sediments which are a major part
of the underlying geology of the Mississippi embayment, as well as
the river sediments along the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys to
the north and east (note the red fingers extending up these valleys
in the image above), large quakes have the potential for more
widespread damage than major quakes on the west coast.
Additionally, the area affected will be larger since beyond the
rift zone itself there are few other faults to attenuate the
seismic waves.

_______________________________________________________________________________
The coordinates (should have) brought you to an information
display near the head of the Madrid Bend formed by the New Madrid
earthquake.

To log this earthcache, post a photo of yourself at this
marker with your GPSr visible and include your gps
coordinates.
NOTE: This marker is reported MISSING! Here is
the description from the KY Historical Marker Database. It may have
been relocated somewhere along KY313. If spotted, please mark
coords and include in your log. The marker:


Madrid Bend
(Marker Number: 1859)
County: Fulton
Location: Near head of Madrid Bend, Jct. KY 313 at Hart&apos;s
Service Rd.
Description: Kentucky claimed land to the westernmost middle of
Mississippi River-to this bend. Kentucky and Tennessee disagreed
over boundary line until the Cox-Peebles survey, 1858-59, brought
compromise. Nearby village of Compromise prospered during steamboat
era but was eroded by the river ca. 1880. Neck joining bend to
Tenn., once three miles wide, is now less than one mile across.
In absence of the marker, please post an image of
yourself and the feature you found
interesting.
And to demonstrate the educational value of this cache, please
email answers to the following questions:
1. How many major earthquakes occurred here during 1811 and
1812?
2. What is the probability that another major earthquake will
occur along this fault by 2040?
3. In what year did the nearby village erode into the
Mississippi river?
4. What is the highest manmade point that can be seen NW of the
listed coordinate?

2009-10-02 Jarihend, We were out enjoying the fall weather and doing the earthcaches in the area.   What a change it made in this part of the world.  The drive took us to a very remote area and the road was something else after all the recent rain.   Mrs. Jarihend refused to ride in the car part of the way and did now want to be in car when I turned around because the road stopped where trees covered the road or pathway.  Gathered all the info needed and took pictures.   Email will be on way soon.   Just returned from long trip but will upload them tonight.   Thanks for such an interesting cache.

2009-08-17 CaptainPunkin, I used the prior finders&apos; coordinates to locate the &quot;missing&quot; marker.  This road was straight as an arrow and I felt compelled to test out the highend speed of my new car.  Fortunately, this marker was near a sharp curve so I got over the temptation.  Thanks for the EC - another ARF cache bites the dust!  OOHRAH!

2009-07-31 Lostnspace, Found this really neat EC while on a vacation trip from East Tennessee to Northeast Arkansas. This area really wasn&apos;t on the way, but to get to visit three earthcaches and see some really unusual features, I had to make the detour!  I got to meet the ECs owner at GW7 and I know he&apos;s as big a nut about earthcaches as I am. Althought I didn&apos;t find the marker, I did enjoy visiting the area and learning even more about the earthquake.
Found it
2009-06-28 Nolehawks, We could only get to within .2 mile of GZ due to downed trees.  We turned around and tried to come in another way but ended up on private property.  So we returned to our original closest point for the picture.  
When we got to Illinois where we were visiting my husband&apos;s 92 year old father, we told him where we had been.  He know all about the New Madrid earthquakes, the dates of the Earthquakes and Reelfoot Lake!
Thanks for all the information on the earthquakes.  TFTC

2009-05-25 FSUDad, Don&apos;t think too much about earthquakes in this part of the country...  Nice to get off the paved road and head down some dirt two tracks.  We were not able to get to GZ because of the amount of water in the area... somewhere around .3 we were required to turn around.  We did see the relocated sign on our way here.  Thanks for another EarthCache.l
Found it
2008-07-20 KY Hiker, Wow, this is one cache that I wish there was high water and we chose not to continue.... but being a crazy cacher I continued on into the land of no return. I never had to turn on my 4 wheel drive even though I went through mud and water. If you do not want scratches on your vehicle you may want to park and walk the last 4/10ths of a mile. You can see from my pics what I went through and it appears from the previous logs I am the first to get to the zero point. Happy Hiker was wondering what I was doing, and questioned my sanity at one point as I said &quot;Its OK honey, no hill for a hiker&quot;. My concern as I kept getting in deeper was I going to find a place to turn around as I kept that to myself. Yes there is one as I breathed a sigh of relief. This was the most remote cache I have driven to in a long time while wondering if I could get back out. Yeah, I love these kind except for the scratches on my truck. I turned around about 75&apos; past the zero point and for those with a winch the road does continue past the curve. Thanks for a good one ARF. [:D][:D]

Then we ran for the car to warm up!

OCW K-Team and N0WNV.  Talk about a cold day!!!  And the wind!!  What a day to be caching-we must be insane.  In the teens and 50 mph winds.  Did I mention how cold it was?

2008-12-31 CP the Science Guy, I&apos;m not declaring a DNF since I never got to the cache site. I took my truck down the Bad dirt road (I do not recommend it) and got close to the cache and decided since I&apos;m not from around here getting help might be a problem. So even it the dead of winter I do not recommend it. There is a giant wash out that would possibly kill someone if they were not paying attention to the road along with deep holes and ruts to deal with. I turned around about .1 miles away form the cache. Well maybe next time in warmer weather I&apos;ll just walk the long way.

Kentucky&apos;s Lowest Geographical Point



The New Madrid Earthquake, the largest earthquake ever
recorded in the contiguous United States, centered near here on
February 7, 1812. It got its name from its primary location in the
New Madrid Seismic Zone, near New Madrid (MAD&apos;-rid),
Missouri.
Some sections of the Mississippi River appeared to run backwards
for a short time and result of the quakes, large areas sank into
the earth and new lakes were formed, notably Reelfoot Lake in
Tennessee.

 
The Mississippi River changed its course, creating numerous
geographic exclaves, including Madrid Bend, where
Kentucky&apos;s lowest point occurs at 247 feet msl.
The Kentucky Bend is comprised of unconsolidated sediments which
are a major part of the underlying geology of Kentucky&apos;s
westernmost physiographic region, the Mississippi Embayment,
as well as river sediments from the Mississippi and Ohio River.


____________________________________________________________
The coordinate will bring you to a location on Toney&apos;s Toehead
road at the KY/TN state line. Just west of here, where the state
line meets the Mississippi River is Kentucky&apos;s (geographical)
Low Point of 247 feet msl depending on river pool
level).


_______________________________________________________________________________
Depending on the river level it may not be possible to reach
the LISTED waypoint.

NOTICE!
Never enter water to complete this cache. Here, the LOW POINT is
WHEREVER the Mississippi River water meets Kentucy soil on the day
you visit! The LOW POINT is never &apos;UNDER WATER&apos;. 
You may log this e&apos;cache with your &apos;closest I could safely
get&apos; photo and the answers to the questions.

 

_______________________________________________________________________________
To log this earthcache, post a photo of yourself at the
water&apos;s edge with your GPSr.
And to demonstrate the educational value of this visit, email
answers to the following questions:
1. What created the exclave where the low point occurs?
2. What is the name of the physiographic region where the low
point is located?
3. What manmade object is visible as the highest point (810ft)
for miles on a bearing of 296-degrees, just 2.7 miles away?
4. Based on your GPSr reading, how close were you able to get to
the actual coordinates before you met the swollen Mississippi River
(don&apos;t go any farther)?

Kentucky Bend - Exclave


The Kentucky Bend, variously called the New Madrid Bend,
Bessie Bend or Bubbleland is an exclave of Fulton County,
Kentucky.
In geography, an exclave is a country (state) or part of
a country mostly surrounded by the territory of another country or
wholly lying within the boundaries of another country.
This enclave is a piece of land on a hairpin turn of the
Mississippi River and is completely surrounded by the states
of Tennessee and Missouri.
The Bend exclave lies in the Mississippi Embayment
physiographic region of Kentucky and consists of alluvial
deposits and loess. Loess (derived from glacial deposits) areas are
geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily.
The &apos;neck&apos; of the enclave once measured three miles but has been
eroded to a width of less than a mile.
It is bounded by the Mississippi River, Ohio River, and
Tennessee River (Pennyrile physiographic region) and includes the
lowest elevation in the state.


The Kentucky Bend covers a land area of 17.5 sq mi and the only
highway into the area is Tennessee State Route 22.
The exclave was created due to the shift in course of the
Mississippi after the New Madrid Earthquakes in 1811 and
1812.
Surveyors marking the boundary between Kentucky and Tennessee
had estimated where their line would meet the Mississippi. Later,
more detailed surveys revealed the division of the loop. The
western border of Kentucky is designated as the Mississippi
River, as is the eastern border of Missouri ? thus the creation
of a &apos;notch&apos; for Kentucky, but not for Tennessee.
The state of Tennessee contested the inclusion of the Kentucky
Bend in the state of Kentucky, and it was legally part of Obion
County, Tennessee, until at least 1848, but Tennessee eventually
dropped its claim.
At the posted coordinates you will find a historical marker. The
text on that marker is reproduced here:
COMPROMISE

Location: Kentucky-Tennessee line, KY
313
Description: To end Kentucky-Tennessee boundary
dispute, Cox-Peebles survey began at Compromise, Ky., west of this
point. Surveyors marked boundary eastward every 5 miles to
Cumberland mountains. The 1858-59 line, for the first time,
verified border to inhabitants, as well as to county and state
officials. In 1860, Ky. and Tenn. recognized it as official
boundary between the two states.

2009-10-02 Jarihend, Another great earthcache!   We enjoyed visiting all earthcaches in this area and all were unique and informative.  Great earthcaches and a lot to learn about,   The cemetery was well kept.   The area seemed so remote and it was strange finding houses out here.   I&apos;d be sleeping with one eye open due to what was going underground.  Thanks for the fun cache.     Email and pictures are on the way soon.

This was a really interesting area, but a swampboat would have been more useful after the rains and flooding in the area. Fortunately the trusty 4Runner saw me through!  Answers were emailed and photo of me at the marker attched. This area really is worth the detour off of the main road to visit. Thanks ARF!

Slinky Jr 
CD with the book of Romans from the New Testament (KJV).
Log book and pen

This cache is located in a new city park in Mayfield off a gravel trail.  It is best to park at the parking lot off of South 10th Street.  The cache is not far off of the trail, be careful in the summer for thorn bushes.  Also, enjoy the park with picnic tables, playground, and sand volleyball.    

The coordinates were within 20 to 25 feet according to my Garmin. Please log your find in the log book and let me know if it needs maintence.

DESC: This container is located near an old Cape Girardeau County Cemetery, just outside of Jackson
there is alot of construction going on, on the highway, but there is still a spot to park.



Here is a little bit of interesting trivia on this cemetery, supposedly August Busch, of the Anheiser/Busch beer company buried is Mother in this cemetery,  I have not found her burial spot as of yet.  But it is possible that she is buried there, as August had a Summer home just up from the Bollinger mill sight. That home is still there and being lived in today.

There was also a girl that drowned in the creek behind the cemetery, about 75 years ago, she may still be wandering around there today

, You will be looking for a small brown container, with room for a log sheet, pencil, and a  few small items.  The cache is located somewhere around an old Cape Girardeau county cemetery name Mogler Cemetery. Please stay within the cemetery area,  the container is not on the nearby private property.   It is not handicap accessible. There are steep inclines the area is kinda rocky, and muddy at times.  I have been told you may want to watch out for snakes in the Summer time. Permission was granted to place the cache.  Parking is located in the way point below.

We came in from the north, parking at a wide spot of Hwy 34/72 and hiking up the limestone blocks up into and through the trees – there must be another way in, maybe to the west. We zeroed in on the coordinates and spotted the cache easily in spite of its paint. TNLNSL. Thanks, spankyjoe for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

2008-05-10 Hobbit Taz, slightly muddy climb and finding the way in was a little &quot;Sticky&quot; situation from our approach, but made it with little trouble.  I just couldnt figure out why would anyone want to bring us here?  Seemed to be an Iffy place for a hide.  Once we broke through the buschwack realized what the real find was.  Cool.  Found cache quickly.  Felt sorry for the poor horse.  It kept giving us the sad eyes but withheld temptation to mess with it any since didnt know the reason for its pinning up and left the way we came.  TFTC.  Another good cache (great finding these little known areas).

Out doing some caching in the area with CribbageWitch after coming down for the SEMOG WWFM Event and Post WWFM Lunch Events. After Finishing our meal we headed off for some caches and to work off the meal we just had.

This is a new cache to our town but has been seen around before. A nice little micro that will be hard pressed to be had on certain days.  Hope you enjoy your day in the park and if there are a bunch of muggles around hope you enjoy the game.

2009-11-07 L Frank, We knew this was going to be a nice caching day, so we decided to grab a few close to home, head south, and see how far we get. Parked at the concession stand and walked over to this one as it was getting dark. Searched around a bit with a flashlight, and finally made the grab. Thanks, Snake428, for the cache.

Post Reviewer Note
2009-12-16 *gln, Greetings,

I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs.

I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache.
[b]
If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.
[/b] 

If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. 


From the guidelines...       http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint      &quot;... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem.  This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b]  normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing.&quot;  

Thanks for your understanding.

When you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an &quot;Owner Maintenance&quot; log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don&apos;t let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!



[B][RED]HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS[/B][/RED]
Respond by posting a new [b] Note[/b]. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select &quot;Post Note&quot; as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I&apos;ll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process. 

If you&apos;re reading this as email, don&apos;t reply to the sending address. It won&apos;t reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.

[red] DISABLING CACHE: [/red]


Greetings,

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last couple logs on this cache, it appears that this cache may be  in need of repair or at least should be checked.   Since there may  still be  a container in the  area, I can not archive it.  When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then.

Hope things get fixed up soon.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

If everything turns out to be fine you can enable this  at any time. 

[b]If I do not hear from you about fixing up this cache, I will assume that it is abandoned  and archive this cache  sometime in the future. 
[/b]

 <desc>Soggy Bottom Boys Live by Influence Waterfowl Calls
Cache ID: GC1B4MV
Multi-cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: This is one cache in a series of caches I will place. Each of these caches will have something to do with a scene in the movie Oh Brother Where Art Thou.
The cords listed above will take you to the front of a building which would be a great place for the Soggy Bottom Boys to perform live!  Just as they did in the movie at the political rally you would get to hear them belt out &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; which would be &quot;mighty fine&quot;!  

While you are at the front of the building take a look at the star on the front!  Count the number of points on that star an then multiply it times 2.6.  The result should be a two digit number.  To check your math add each of the two digits together and the sum should be 8. One side of the building has some things which are more numerous than the result of the number of points x 2.6. and you could hide a cache beside it.  Starting with the one closest to the front of the building, proceed until you reach the number you came up with as the result, and you are there! 

While you are at the hiding spot for the cache look to the North and just a bit east and you will see the top of the Graves County Court House.  The top point of the church steeple like part of the court house is a bench mark!  So after logging this cache be sure to log the GD1536 bench mark!


 I placed this cache with he permission of the building manager, Wayne!

2009-06-07 DHCPA29, Lil casper, patronqueen, and I spent 25-30 mintues looking for this one and came up empty.  After reading previous logs, I think it may be missing.  If it is still there, it is very well hidden and I apologize for the needs maintenance log.

Appearantly, we just didn&apos;t find it.  Gives me a reason to go back to Mayfield in the near future.

 <desc>Go Take A Walk! Part Nine by JohnTee
Cache ID: GC1BEWE
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: GO TAKE A WALK! and do a series of geocaches along Cape Girardeau&apos;s
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail. This is Part Nine of a series of
caches along the trail, numbered as placed, and NOT in any sequence
along the trail. 
The walk is all paved asphalt, with few, gentle inclines and
occasional bridges. Trail open from 6:00 a.m. ? 11:00 p.m.
Not handicapped accessible.
The recreation trail is a very popular place when the weather is
the least bit nice. You can expect walkers, joggers and bicyclists.
Be aware of muggles as you cache along the trail. 
This cache has a &apos;tether&apos; to keep it from floating away in
floods. Please place the loop back over the obvious structure so it
doesn&apos;t get lost. It&apos;s a small cache and, while well camo&apos;ed, is
located in a highly visible area along the trail. You will need to
be be very aware of muggles and use stealth.
There are boggy/swampy areas along the trail. If it is wet,
you may get muddy feet. You can expect mosquitoes when it is warm,
or has been wet. You may find ticks. There may be some Poison Ivy,
however, it doesn&apos;t seem to be too bad along the trail. If you&apos;re
lucky, you may see deer in this area. I&apos;ve seen them crossing the
trail just south of the cache several times.
The recreation trail can be accessed from multiple points in
Cape Girardeau - time to explore!
Be sure you don&apos;t miss other caches in the area.
Accuracy
Many sets of coordinates, with 10&apos; EPE, using a Vista HCx, were
averaged to give the final set listed here.
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail
 For joggers, walkers, bicyclists, rollerbladers and skateboarders,
the 4.4-mile asphalt Cape La Croix Recreation Trail connects
the
Osage Community Centre on the north and Shawnee Park Sports
Complex
on the south, while avoiding the need to cross city streets. It
provides users with a safe recreational experience as it skirts
the
banks of the Cape La Croix Creek.
For more information on the trail, visit the href=
&quot;http://www.cityofcapegirardeau.org/ourdepartments/parksandrecreation/trails/default.aspx&quot;&amp;gt; 

 Cape Girardeau Parks and Recreation web page.

Permission to place geocaches in Cape Girardeau Parks was
obtained from Dan Muser, Parks and Recreation Department.

Riverside Park located on the city&apos;s southwest side. The focal point of the park is the impressive concrete band shell, constructed in the 1930s and refurbished in 1994. The band shell is the center of many of the events in the park including the Fourth of July Celebration, the Blues Festival, and many others. Riverside Park also features a Veteran&apos;s Monument, originally dedicated in 1928 by the American Legion. The monument was recently rededicated in 2006 after the addition of flag poles, a ramp, sidewalk and benches.Shelters and the recreation center are available for rentals listed below.

Riverside Park is also home to Chep Kessel Field, which hosts  Adult Softball and American Legion Baseball games. Vintage Base Ball games with the Murphysboro Clarkes are played at Longfellow Park.

2009-11-07 TsukiakariUsagi, So today was a journey to break a lot of personal records... 1 day, 1 city, 31 caches bookmarked, 9 hours of daylight (8:15am - 5:15pm)... After it was all said and down, there were 23 total attempts at caches, 17 of those were found, 4 were DNF&apos;s, and 2 were noted due to various circumstances. The following is a story of one of those caches:
-----
This was my seventeenth cache of the day and my GPS had a fit when I first got to the coordinates.  First it would say one direction, then it would say another, I&apos;d get over there, and it&apos;d tell me to go back to where I was.  I was about to give up, when I had an idea, and luckily, that idea paid off and jackpot!  Cache found :o)  The last log posted here on the website prior to mine says that they placed a travel bug, but I didn&apos;t see it and the only people to sign the paper log at the cache (Tom and Keegan Vance) haven&apos;t signed the website, so it&apos;s possible they might have it.  I don&apos;t know the info on the TB so I can&apos;t go and check on it.  TFTC though!

P.S.  The picture I attached shows part of the road flooded below the cache site.  This park&apos;s a mess right now because of all the rains a couple weeks ago.  Hopefully it all goes back to normal soon.

2009-10-10 nyttymer2000, I ran out of time before I had to head back home to Wisconsin, so I drove back out to this one( thank heavens it was an easy park n&apos; go.  I was lookin for a cache to place TB Scooper Trooper in and he needed a decent sized cache to go in, but unfortunately this was all the bigger I could find. So I hope he enjoys his new home.  Good luck on his journey.  Also took toy camera, soccer ball water toy, and smokey the bear erasure to make room for scooper.

DESC: this cache is a lock-n-lock container that has room for coins and maybe some TB&apos;s. also has a log and pencil and some swag for starters.
i dont think we can ever give enough tribute to those that have served our county.  even this small town and its area around it has its heros.  this cache is to honor their service.

this is located in a very nice park, so please obey all park rules.  the road is one-way only so keep that in mind. it has been placed with permission of the city administrator. you will need to do some math to get the final coordinates for the cache itself.

at the first stage  find the number of the boy scout troop that assisted in the building then add 99. then subtract this from the last 3 digits in the Latitude.  this will give you A.   then count the number of names in the far right column and add 65. add this to the original longitute last 3 digits and this will give you B.

final point should read  N37 13.A   and   W089 31.B

good luck

There was a dog-training exercise using some rockets going on just west of WP1, but it didn&apos;t interfere with our search in the least. We got the information and reparked the car to be closer to the final. There was enough PI for all of us at the final, so we were cautious about where we poked and peeked.. eventually we spotted it in a likely spot. TNLNSL.

This memorial is dedicated to the memory of Jackson County&apos;s Veterans of all Wars. Erected Nov. 11 1928 and then rededicated just a few years ago. There are a pair of 37mm anti-tank guns displayed here and I see kids playing with them all the time.

2009-11-21 cop061598, this cache was for sure my most interesting.  while looking for this very clever hide, i was explaining geocaching to a muggle.  her little boy was playing on the concrete walls.  as i was signing the log i saw the little boy lose his balance and fall onto one of the tank guns and split the back of his head open.  i had to run to my jeepcaching machine and grab some napkins to help stop the bleeding.  

all ended well.  the bleeding stopped and the cache was found

planes, guns, tanks, etc alway drive me crazy.  I did not have much time left before the event so I just looked a little while and decided I would come back after getting the rest of the caches in the park if there was still time.  Fortunately, a fellow cacher gave me a hint.  It reminds me of a helicoptor cache in St Charles MO.  I also got tricked the same way with it!

Riverside Park also features a Veteran&apos;s Monument, originally dedicated in 1928 by the American Legion. The monument was recently rededicated in 2006 after the addition of flag poles, a ramp, sidewalk and benches.Shelters and the recreation center are available for rentals listed below.

Riverside Park is also home to Chep Kessel Field, which hosts Adult Softball and American Legion Baseball games. Vintage Base Ball games with the Murphysboro Clarkes are played at Longfellow Park.

After it was all said and down, there were 23 total attempts at caches, 17 of those were found, 4 were DNF&apos;s, and 2 were noted due to various circumstances. The following is a story of one of those caches:

This was the eighteenth cache of the day... I found it after a little bit of hunting.  The log was a little damp, but it wasn&apos;t unsignable.  My GPS really hated trying to find this one, but I did eventually find it and got the smiley face.  Perseverance ftw!  TFTC!

This cache is located at the Black Bayou Wildlife Observation
Tower in Lake County TN. This area provides a beautiful location
for the observation area for all types of wildlife, including deer
and mostly ducks especially when they flood the fields. It is also
a quiet and peaceful area just to get away if needed. After finding
the cache take the time to look around and visit the tower. Be on
the lookout for slithering creatures in this area as well.
This location had another cache here previously, but it was
muggled repeatedly and was finally archived. We are hoping that
this cache will be a permanent fixture at Black Bayou.

Cache ID: GC1BX99
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D2.5/T2.5
DESC: The above coordinates will take you to the mouth of a crack in the
bluff. There is no satellite reception in the crevice so this is as
close as I can get you. After arriving at the coordinates you will
have to search for the cache about 12 feet inside the bluff, there
should be plenty of light available but a flashlight will be needed
to explore deeper into this and other cracks and caves in the
bluff.
So what is with the name? 
In the spring of 2007 Fairy Flirt and I were exploring War Bluff
and came to this crack in the Bluff so we went in to explore. There
was a musky stench coming from the crack that we could not explain
but we kept going. There was some light from above but it got
pretty dark and as I got down in the bottom and came to a Y, I was
looking up to the left to see if it was passable or if I should
turn the 90 degrees to continue when all of the sudden we heard a
thud! I looked at Brenda, she looked at me, we asked ?Was that
you?, so we decided the thud was not us. Out of the corner of my
eye I saw movement at the next turn of the crack and something that
sounded pretty big started scrambling through leaves so we turned
and got out of there as quick as we could. From outside we could
hear hissing, movement, and guttural/growling noises. Then a
horrible sewage smell came from the crack. I got a flashlight and a
trekking pole but could not make myself go back down in the tight
area of the crack to take a look. I climbed up some rocks and tried
to look around the corner but could not see the animal but could
still hear it and smell it. So for a year I have wondered what it
was. Suggestions from a baby Bigfoot, badger, cougar or buzzard
have been put forward but I have not been back until I placed this
cache. I braved the crack to place the cache and did not see, hear
or smell anything so the mystery still remains. 

After finding this cache continue on around the bluff to find War
Bluff Cache (GC1D8T3). Trails circle the War Bluff Stone Fort and
there is a great view from on top of the Buff at (N37 27.608 W88
29.638)

 War Bluff is north of Golconda on Bushwhack road about a mile
north of the Southern IL Audubon society property. Parking is at
the end of the &quot;navigable&quot; road N37 27.692 W88 29.329. Bushwhack
road can get rough past the Audubon society property and a high

2009-12-12 gattmolson, Checked this one out today along with War Bluff, couldn&apos;t find either one and I&apos;m pretty sure I was in the right place.  There was alot of leaves on the ground, but I looked pretty hard.  Will make another trip here and check it out in the Spring.

2009-10-16 maleki, Excited to be the first to log this one in over a year.  I&apos;ve documented our challenge on Bushwhack Rd. in our log for War Bluff, which we found before this one.  Continued back around the bluff to this one.  First explored the wrong crevice for a bit before C said she spotted another around the corner.  Because of the cache description and previous log,  was a bit wary to dive right in.  Tossed  in a few rocks and sticks to listen for any response before finally venturing in a bit.  Still really creepy.  Searched around a bit at the recommend distance then climbed up to a rock ledge to explore some additional spots.  When I pulled myself up, a lens popped out of my glasses.  Oh good, now I&apos;m one eyed looking for a cache container and about to get attacked at any moment - lol.  When I dropped back down and by boots hit the floor I&apos;m pretty sure a got a bit of growling.  C says I&apos;m crazy, but I&apos;ll swear I did.  She was not going in I noticed.  Spotted an area i wanted to check but had scrambled back out after the suspected growl.    Tossed in a few more rocks and got no response so went back in and made the find.  Creepy indeed!!  TFTC!  Time for the now one-eyed man to bushwhack back down to Bushwhack Rd.  REAL CACHING AT ITS FINEST!!!!

2009-07-07 KroBro, I came out to do War Bluff today. After logging in, I went to some of the different referenced sites offered. Was standing looking down at the entrance with the camera when I saw something in the viewfinder. Then it moved. Instead of snapping the pic, I pulled away and watched. It was big. White and black fur. Stayed low to the ground. I never saw one before, but I&apos;d say a badger. Needless to say I wasn&apos;t going after this hide.

I&apos;m already looking forward to the fall campout in the S.N.F. area.

Joe, Thanks again for bringing us to a place like this with another cache.
Found it
2008-05-17 regnad, Darua, Ethan, and I spent the weekend with some fellow RVG members camping in Shawnee NF on the RVG Spring Campout.  GEO.Joe told us an interesting story about this location several months back, so while in the area, we had to come over and check it out.  Luckily for us, the &quot;creepy critter&quot; was no where to be found.  However, after a little searching, the new cache was right where the hint said.
Found it
2008-05-17 mikeatnight, This was a fun cache. Found this while on the RVG camp out. Once we arrived at the location the group spread out and explored the area for about 15 minutes then we got serious about finding the cache. Regnad and I got to the general area and I overlooked the cache. He told me to check the area and I told him I already had. I checked it again with my flashlight and there it was. After we explored and rested we headed up the hill to find another cache. Thanks Joe for bringing me to yet another cool place.

 <sym>Traditional Cache</sym>
 <desc>War Bluff by GEO.JOE
Cache ID: GC1D8T3
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T3.0
DESC: This cache in on the ridge just south of the entrance to the War
Bluff Stone Fort.
North of the cache is a nice view of the stone
strewn hillside which is the remnants of the old stone wall that
lead to these Native American sites being called Stone Forts. You
can reach the top of the ridge in two locations from either the
West or the East side of the ridge. There are trails that circle
the bluffs of the stone fort and I recommend that you make the
complete circle to get all the views of this area. 

So What is a Stone Fort? 
Stone Forts are Native American village site built on high
ridge
lines and atop isolated bluffs with limited access. At access
points the Indians would build stone walls 6 ft high to allow for
a
single entrance into the site. These stone forts were first
built
by the Woodland Indians about 2000 years ago then occupied by
Mississippian Indians (Mound Builders) about 1500 to 1000 years
ago. Although they are called &quot;Forts&quot; there is no evidence
these
sites were used for battles. Rock Art found at many of the
sites
represent religious symbols from the Woodland period, therefore,
it
is now believed these sites were first built as religious
sites.
Artifacts from them Mississippian period seem to indicated
these
sites were then used as points along a trade route.

From the cache walk north along the ridge to find the original
entrance into the stone fort. (N37 27.568 W88 29.662) As you
walk
up the terraced sandstone you will see the fallen stones of the
ancient wall on each side of you. Inside the stone fort you can
still see depressions in the ground where the buildings once
stood.
There is a great view from the top of the bluffs at (N37 27.608
W88
29.638). There is a shelter cave at (N37 27.577 W88 29.682)
with
historical writing dating to the early 1900&apos;s. From parking to
the
base of the Bluff is 1/3 mile up hill and to circle the bluff
and
explore the stone fort will required a 1 mile of walking. 

War Bluff is north of Golconda on Bushwhack road about a mile
north
of the Southern IL Audubon society property. Parking is at the
end
of the &quot;navigable&quot; road N37 27.692 W88 29.329. Bushwhack road
can
get rough past the Audubon society property and a high
clearance
vehicle is recommended due to ruts and a few creek crossings. 

If you are interested in visiting another stone fort and for
more
information on Stone Forts you can visit an interpretive trail

2009-12-12 gattmolson, Looked around very hard but couldn&apos;t find the cache, found the place where I thought it should be, but we couldn&apos;t find it.  Bushwack road is in great shape and has fresh gravel.  Had no trouble in my car.  There was a thick layer of leaves on the ground which made searching difficult.  

War Bluff is one of the few Shawnee Landmarks I haven&apos;t visited and it was a very enjoyable walk.  We&apos;ll try again in the spring.

2009-10-16 maleki, Wow!!!   What a great cache up the best named geocaching road(if you can call it that) ever!!!  This is what its all about.  Caching lately seems to be mostly done in walmart parking lots and street corners and other EVIL drive ups - how sad!!   Feel real happy to be some of the only cachers over a year and a half to venture to this one.  The road is aptly named.  Perhaps it is lucky we had not really read the cache description.  We just sort of followed the arrow as we were in the general area.  Bushwhack Road is aptly named.  The comment, now noticed in the cache description that describes it as &apos;navigable&apos; is true.  Normally think of navigable as a boating term and we did have several  small water crossing along Bushwhack Rd. A couple times I had to get out and size up the water crossings to make sure we could handle them.   What was I thinking in our Pontiac Vibe?  Since the description was not initially fully read we missed the part about a high clearance vehicle being desirable too.  Several times along the route, one or both of us had to get out to move rocks, large sticks, etc from our path.  One particular section took a few minutes to clear.  Probably would have been OK in a pickup but not for us.  Finally I noticed that we were about .35 from the cache and noticed a small clearing(sort of) so pulled in.  I had doubts about heading any further the road as another water crossing loomed.  We ended up hiking about a 1/3 mile to what i guess were the suggested parking coords and switched back and headed up.  Beautiful area.  Fall colors starting to come in just a bit. Did the walk around the bluff and found a spot to &apos;summit&apos;.  Happy to find the cache after our little adventure.  Great area for sure and excellent cache.  On the way back we bushwhacked straight back down to our car on Bushwhack Rd.   TFTC!

2009-07-07 KroBro, Most of my fellow cachers from up north know that I always say, &quot;If you are going down to Shawnee, go after GEO.JOE&apos;s caches&quot;

This cache is just one more example of that. Hell, it took me as long driving down BW road as it did the cache. Escort...

I was 1.5 mile out from parking when I ran across a truck coming the other way. A woman wanting to know if I was OK. I told her where I was headed and she understood. She said to never mind the hillbilly. That&apos;s what he calls himself. A trapper of rattlers. Didn&apos;t need to hear that!

So I hit parking and it was slim to pull over and be out of the way. But I managed.

Headed up the trail and it was a steady incline. Once you get to the area though, it is quite spectacular. Here is the mound upon the steepest of areas. So I checked the gps and followed the arrow. Could have done better if I paid attention to the POI&apos;s GJ listed. 

But I finally hit gz after having a fun time and found the stash. Signed in and then explored the other areas. I liked the view of the Ohio valley. That is sweet. 

Took a wrong way out but no need to get into that as I made my way finally. Thanks my friends...

Edit: I just wanted to add that the history lesson here is superb. We have a place back home that is on a larger scale called starved rock. Thanks...

We found this one with a few members of the River Valley Geocachers at our spring campout. Tina was attacked by rabbid thorns near the lookout. The history around this area is amazing when you think about what it took to build in a location like this.

2008-05-18 mikeatnight, After we found the Creepy critter cache we headed uphill to find this cache. Between the creepy critter and this one we stopped by a small cave to look at the historical carvings. After some history about War Bluff we found the cache and headed up the hill a little further. Tina of B&amp;TLand was attacked by a rabid sticker bush and was thrown to the ground. Im glad she was all right. On the way back down the bluff I vaguely recall someone yelling SNAKE. The rest of the hike down the hill is a bit of a blur as I all I can remember is the SNAKE. 
Thanks for another great cache Joe

This location is just one example of that fact.  Thanks for bringing us up here and showing us around this wonderful hidden treasure.

From time to time I plan on placing some &apos;deals&apos; in this cache.  If I ever get any.

DESC: The Cache is located in an area just off the roadside and the terrain is flat and grassy.
The cache is a red bison tube and contains a log only.  Be sure to bring a pen.

The cache is located on the outskirts of a farm.  Feel free to pull in and park in the driveway.  The area has several shade trees and a pond, and would make an excellent place for a picnic.

To get to the cache from the driveway, it is a simple stroll across generally flat grassy land and should be handicap accessible, the only obstacle that might cause some trouble is a small, foot wide area that sometimes gets a little mushy immediately after a rain, it dries up quickly, though, and shouldn&apos;t cause any real problem unless you&apos;re caching durring or immediately after a big rain.

To keep the difficulty of your hunt a three star, don&apos;t read the hint, it will decrease it to a two or two and a half, depending on your interpretation of the hint.

Have Fun!!!

St. Vincent&apos;s Academy - Near the junction of US 60 and KY 141 The
Sisters of Charity from Nazareth, Angela Spink, Frances Garden and
Cecily O&apos;Brien, arrived here in 1820 and founded a girl&apos;s boarding
schoolon this site. With the aid of Father Elisha Durbin, the
school gained renown and was in operation until 1967. The first
Catholic cemetery in the county is adjacent to the school site.
(Buried here are several Revolutionary War soldiers.) Please take
some time to walk around this Great Maintained Cemetery. Check out
the Old Wooden Cross on the walk into GZ. Yes, It&apos;s a Real Tree.
You can park at the coords N37 42.525 W087 50.819 But unless you
have Great backup skills, Don&apos;t drive in no more than from this
point. The headstones are so close together &amp;amp;  it could make it
hard to turn around without hitting one. There is a Marker telling
all about the Academy &amp;amp;  it&apos;s History at coords N37 42.482 W087
50.742 Another parking area is across the road from here too. Might
not be good parking if there is services taking place in the
Church. If you come in from Hwy 60 for this hunt, Be sure to look
on your right side of the road before you get to the Cache area
&amp;amp;  you might even see, Zebras, Llamas, Donkeys, Horses, Years
ago there was Bisons there too? &amp;amp;  No telling what else you may
see?? You tell us what you saw. Your looking for a 35mm Film Camo
can with a Log Only, So BYOP &amp;amp;  replace as you found it. Thx&apos;s!

Wow!  This cache was a real hoot-- and a honk and a whinny and a hee-haw and a bray and a baaah and a pitooey (that&apos;s a camel noise)-- and that was even before we reached the cache site.  Once we did that, the cache itself was a breeze, a piece of cake, a no-brainer and a quickie.  Thanks for making a visit to this cache so many neat things!

The I Love Lucy Show was a comedy series about a Cuban bandleader (Ricky) and his American, wacky, red-headed wife. Ricky was a headliner performer at the Tropicana Club and actually, a star. He really did love Lucy very much but love is not everything! He wished that she&apos;d be satisfied to be a wife and mother. She also had enormous love for her husband, but longed to be a star just like Ricky. She would pull every trick in the book to perform at the Tropicana even though it was clear to everyone that she had no real talent. Occasionally she got a taste of show biz but, of course, she always messed up! Perhaps the best-known example was in I Love Lucy episode #30, &quot;Lucy Does A Television Commercial&quot;. Lucy got hired to do a commercial about a health product called, &quot;Vitameatavegamin&quot;. After several takes it becomes evident that the product is pretty high in alcohol content! Lucy ends out drunk by the end of the episode! In the fourth season of I Love Lucy, Lucy, Ricky and their landlords/friends the Mertzes headed for California where Ricky was being offered a movie contract. These episodes were especially popular as many people of that time had little or no opportunity to travel and it was very exciting to watch! Also, it gave the writers an opportunity to interact Lucy with many top celebrities of the day in California. This was the first program to be recorded directly on film rather than kineoscoped (filming a TV screen). It was also the first to use the &quot;3 camera&quot; process allowing the scenes to be filmed from different angles (That was actually Desi Arnaz&apos;s idea and became the industry standard)!

DESC: This is an easy park and grab and should be handicap accessible as long as access to the nearby parking lot is open.  It may involve a short hike if the access to that lot is chained off.

Permission to place caches in this park has been obtained.
This cache is in honor of all veterans.  The cache is located at the Veteran&apos;s Memorial erected by 3 Eagle Scouts from Troop 5 on November 11, 2007.  The memorial honors men from Cape County that served in the various wars who have flags flying at the North County Park during military holidays.  It&apos;s quite a beautiful sight if you&apos;ve never seen it.

The cache is a regular size lock-n-lock box with ample amounts of swag, so enjoy.

This is a cache that is not designed to be hard at all. It will be a fun cache for all kids and adults. This cache is located in one of the city parks. The Cache requires you to bring a gallon of water with you to retrieve it. I got the idea from a cache that I saw in Springfield MO. It was a very cool idea and I wanted to bring it to this area. Please do not try to retrieve this cache with anything other than water. I hope that this design will be past on so that every geocacher will get the chance to see it. It is not a real long walk to the cache but you do have to walk a little ways. If you have trouble finding this park you need to take star street to get to it.  It is not a very big park but this is where we play softball all the time. This park is never really busy other than us. Hope everyone enjoys this cache and good luck to all cachers. If you have any questions about this cache just email me.

2009-11-08 rick2560, Headed to Perryville this afternoon with the grandkids when we discovered there was an abundance of cache&apos;s in the area! Found this cache rather quickly today when we noticed that something just didn&apos;t belong there...was a very cool idea &amp; actually we used only about 3/4 a gallon of the water...LOL! 

However, we believe the cache size should be reworked per Geocaching.com&apos;s definition of cache sizes:

&quot;Micro (35 mm film canister or smaller – less than approximately 3 ounces or .1 L – typically containing only a logbook or a logsheet) 
Small (sandwich-sized plastic container or similar – less than approximately 1 quart or 1 L – holds trade items as well as a logbook) 
Regular (plastic container or ammo can about the size of a shoebox) 
Large (5 gallon/20 L bucket or larger)&quot;

The cache itself is actually a MICRO, that holds a log &amp; pencil &amp; is placed in a larger container, that cannot hold swag for trade because of the water component. 

Also, being an Occupational Therapist who works with wheelchair bound people everyday, I don&apos;t believe the attribute &quot;handicap accessible&quot; is appropriate unless a person uses a POWER chair (even then there may be issues). The field was quite soggy today, but even if dry, it was a little to lumpy/bumpy for a wheelchair to maneauver to the cache. 

TFTC!!!! We are going to try &amp; implement it in our area soon.
Just our opinions...for whatever they are worth!

I guess I did not have my caching glasses on or something, because today I walked up and it stuck out like a sore thumb. I walked right up and had my hand on it within seconds.
After all of you find it you can make fun of me for taking more time to find the cache than it took me to solve the puzzle. And I didn&apos;t even solve it the way it was supposed to be solved [:O]
I guess the good news is that there are at least two ways to solve the puzzle. Well and then there is the process of elimination if you check and eliminate all the places that it is not then you will eventually get to where it is - Let me know how that goes for you [; )] Hey, I&apos;ll give you a hint - It is not within 528 ft of another cache, now go start looking [:D]
Thanks Influence for the creative puzzle.

The Love Boat (simply Love Boat in its final season) is an American television series set on a cruise ship, which aired on the ABC Television Network from 1977 until 1986. It was part of ABC&apos;s Saturday night &quot;one-two punch&quot; along with Fantasy Island, until the latter show ended in 1984.

The original 1976 made-for-TV movie on which the show was based, also titled The Love Boat, was itself based on the nonfiction book The Love Boats by Jeraldine Saunders, a real-life cruise director. Two more TV movies (titled The Love Boat II and The New Love Boat, respectively) would follow before the series began its run.

The executive producer for the series was Aaron Spelling, who produced several successful series for ABC in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

The sitcom was usually set aboard a cruise liner called the Pacific Princess, whose passengers and crew had romantic and funny adventures every week. Other ships used were twin sister Island Princess, the Stella Solaris (for a Mediterranean cruise), Pearl of Scandinavia (for a Chinese cruise), the Royal Viking Sky (for European cruises) and the Royal Princess (for a Caribbean cruise).

DESC: You are looking for a micro container on a train! The nearest
parking is for 15min ONLY! So you may want to park somewhere else
and make a short walk to the cache location!
Well here we go again! My boy loves trains and I love placing
caches! I know how this is one of the most hated combos out there!
The micro on a train combo! But, it should keep you busy! Maybe you
will find it right off but then again it may take a numbers of
attempts! Hey if you have to log a DNF on this one that is nothing
to be ashamed of! I know how bad it stinks to have your town
cleared and no caches left to find. I hope this one will provide
you with a number of caching opportunities and help get you through
those long waits between new hides being placed! 



REMEMBER to head the signs and stay off of the train! I did not
get on it to place the cache so please stay off when finding the
cache!
If you DNF this one place your vote as to if I should move it up
to a level 5 difficulty. Heck if you do find it you can place your
vote as well!
PLEASE DO NOT POST ANY SPOILERS IN YOUR LOGS!
THERE WILL BE NO HINTS OR HELP FROM ME UNTILL THE FTF! Well
OK!
When the cache was placed I used a Garmin Camo GPSr. For those who
are are unfamiliar with the Camo it is the low boy on the Etrex
totem pole. So when you are getting the coords for a cache between
a flood wall and a locomotive the Camo is not you best tool for
achieving the best coords, but I tried. So I get reports of the
coords being on the wrong side of the flood wall, and being 45 min
away I used the same coords that put me and 394 other people, as of
today, within feet of the cache, they have worked 395 times before.
About the changing of the last digit on both the west and north
part of the coords... Well put both into google earth and you will
see that that is a difference of 7.69 feet. We all know we get to
GZ and radiate from there. Oh how I wish this cache was something
more than a magnetized film can! Then I would be able to be proud
of the hide! Nope, so I am stuck with this being nothing but an
attempt to get you the people of the geocaching world to place a
pay back cache to haunt me! Want someone to blame? Look up Mean
Streak! Yea that&apos;s the one! I happened upon it and it was my
inspiration! Oh how I wished I had the dough to just hop in the car
and take a chance on being the FTF. But, I have not the funds and
am reduced to calling down the thunder by placing a hard
cache

2009-12-20 KyWildturkey, I came, I looked, I did not find....it NEVER entered my mind that cache was not there!!  I just logged my hated DNF and went home sad, but smiling...I&apos;ve been beat again.
If I lived closer, I would have been a regular visitor.  I do not know any of the cachers that are posting now but it seems that this has once again become a forum!  All because of one cacher who maybe should consider adding the word &quot;cry&quot; in front of their screen name. Congratulations to finders...[^]

2009-12-20 GEO.JOE, I was hoping that the cache was like a shy animal and now that it has shown itself and let others handled it, I was hoping that it would come out of it&apos;s hiding spot for me. But I think the cache may have gotten cold and went back into hiding again.  [:D]  I spent another 20 min with a flashlight looking in spots I have not looked and sticking my hands in spot I have not felt before. It was 31 degrees and the wind was blowing right in my face so when my hands started hurting I called it quits for the night. I have been saying all week that I wanted to get back out there to find it before the rush of finders swarmed in, but, I just waited too long, However, it hasn&apos;t made it any easier for me and I&apos;m too broke to even bribe anyone  [; )]
Congratulations to all of the finders!

I had just gotten in the car to warm up because I couldn&apos;t feel my toes and as soon as I looked back at them Tgiz had his arms in the air and everybody was screaming HOORAY!!!  I ran outside and they had changed the screaming to high-hiving.  We all could say that this cache definitely deserves a 5 difficulty.  TFTC SL

This cache is a replacement cache in this area there have been a few before it that have not held up to well hope this one better luck.  It is located in Perryville City Park along a brand new walking/biking trail.  There are a few more located along this trail so do enjoy a great day and take a nice walk.  Hope you enjoy your time here in our great town. This one could be tricky to get back how it was so take some caution and get it back right so as not to compromise the cache safety.

CACHE IS NOT AT THESE COORDINATES!!!  CACHE IS NOT AT THESE COORDINATES!!!  AGAIN, CACHE IS NOT AT THESE COODINATES!!!

The cache is not located at the coordinates above, but is located within 1 mile of the coordinates.  Here is one for the Math Geocachers, and don&apos;t dispair if you are not a math wizard, you can still figure this out.  

To find the cache, you will need to solve this math problem:
1) How long, in minutes, would it take you to drive 18 miles if for the first mile you went 18MPH, the second mile you went 17MPH, all the way down to going 1MPH for the last mile?

2) How long, in minutes, would it take you to drive 24 miles if for the first mile you went 24MPH, the second mile you went 23MPH, all the way down to going 1MPH for the last mile?

Take the whole number without rounding (basically drop any decimals) from both questions and find the answer for each letter:
A = (Answer from #1) * 2 ? 3 = _ _ _ (A 3-digit number)
B = (Answer from #2) * 3 = _ _ _ (A 3-digit number)

Coordinates to Cache:
37º 03.A
88º 40.B

I have done the problem several times and with several different rounding options.  I have found that anything over 2 decimal rounding works with no rounding always the best option.  1 decimal rounding or whole number round WILL give you the incorrect answer.  In addition, the coordinates are an average of three different readings with 15 feet accuracy.

Cache:
Cache is a small 3 x 3 x 4 inch black container.  It will hold the log sheet and a few small trade items.  The closest parking spot is approximately 100ft (or more) away from the cache, but the terrain is mainly flat.

Check your coordinates:

Additional Waypoints
Hint: The sum of the numbers from A should add up to 10 and the sum of the numbers from B will add up to 21.

2009-07-06 Tsnake, Number six of the day.  The locatin was off about twenty feet for me.  If you subtract 5 from the answer for A (check sum is 6)and use the number that I think is correct for B (check sum is 22) it gets you closer.  The owner did help me some because I couldn&apos;t agree with the geochecker.com website.  Nice area.  It&apos;s amazing how quickly you get into rural area around here.  Left bowling pin (very small).  Cycle through Moun10Bike coin

2009-06-17 regnad, Cyclonic contacted me and asked if I would be interested in going on a caching run on his day off.  Having spent the last few weeks working on remodeling our first house, I was more than eager to take a day off and get some caching under my belt.  After discussing different areas to hit, we settled on heading toward Paducah since there were several new caches that we both needed to hit.

I&apos;ve tried this cache once before, but due to the Ice Storm &apos;09 damage, I had to abandon my search.  However, since we were in area, we decided to stop and give it a go.  After a little searching, we were able to finally find the cache and sign the log.  Thanks for bringing us to this great little cemetery.  I would not have known it existed otherwise.

A note to future hunters of this cache - Bring your camera!
I arrived before daylight. I didn&apos;t want to wake the campground owners so I parked in a wide spot on the road and walked to a trail entrance up the road. I started my walk when there was just enough light to see without a flashlight. By the time I arrived at GZ there was plenty of light to enjoy the view. That&apos;s quite a swimming hole. After an extensive search, I found the cache and signed the log. Dropped off two TBs.
Took a different trail out and ended up walking through the campground. Nobody around.
Thanks for the great cache.

 <desc>Columbus Bluff Earthcache by KYrockhound
Cache ID: GC1GBXZ
Earthcache
SIZE: Not chosen
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: The Columbus bluff is a historic loess bluff overlooking the Mississippi River at Columbus, Kentucky.  It is part of a landscape feature that extends along the Mississippi River as far South as Louisiana.
Often geology has played a part in history.  This is a story of loess, blended with an historical event.  The bluffs of Columbus-Belmont State Park played a role in the Civil War.  This park includes the site of a former Confederate fort.  The elevation of the bluff gave a commanding view of the Mississippi River looking across toward Missouri.  That is why the fort had been placed here.  In addition to the fort earthworks, there is an anchor and a piece of the chain that had been strung across the river to block movement of Union gunboats.

Approach Columbus on highway 123.  The park entrance on Cheatham Street is well marked.  Drive the park road until it ends at the parking lot at N 36 45.897  W 089 06.715.

A substantial part of the bluff&apos;s elevation is due to deposition of loess.  Loess is defined as wind-blown particles of predominantly silt size.  During and following a sequence of ice age glacial cycles, massive quantities of water flowed through the area now occupied by the Mississippi River  It is believed that each winter when the vast flood plains dried, strong winds blowing across the mud flats picked up large quantities of silt which then were deposited across the landscape.  This process took place over thousands of years.  Here near the source, the silt deposits are as deep as 40-50 feet.  Many of the soils of the Jackson Purchase consist of this loess.  The depth of loess decreases as one goes eastward from the floodplain source.  Fifty miles to the East, in Calloway County, Kentucky the loess depth averages six feet, deep enough for the soils to be highly productive.  On the steeper slopes the loess may have eroded away, leaving other soil parent material.

Properties of loess are important.  Loess, when water-saturated, becomes slippery and cannot bear it&apos;s own weight.  This instability has led to the collapse of portions of the bluff south of here at Hickman, Kentucky, where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have attempted to stabilize that bluff to prevent loss of land and homes.

Gullies in loess tend to be steep sided.  Author Bruce Catton, in his book, &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; has said that along the Mississippi River Valley some of the Confederate forces took defensive positions along the gullies found in the loess bluffs.  In other words, the gullies, like trenches, offered protective cover bothe for men and their weapons.  As you walk up the hill toward the lookout house, notice the deep gully (north)to your right

Three forces came together to create this bluff and others like it: (1) the grinding action of glaciers pulverized some of the soil and rock into flour-like silt particles, (2) melt water from the glacial ice created movement of the silt onto the flood plains and (3) wind carried the loess to the bluff area and beyond.  Some other major loess bluffs in the U.S. parallel the Missouri River system with especially prominent bluffs in western Iowa and eastern Nebrasks.

When logging your visit, post a picture of yourself at the lookout house with the river in the background. E-mail me the answers to these questions:  1. What is the weight of one link of the chain that was stretched across the river.  2. Estimate the depth of that gully located to your right as you face the river.

 <desc>River to River - Godwin Trail 2 : ) by PomonaCachers
Cache ID: GC1XD2E
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T3.5
DESC: (Part 2) The Trail is not an overly difficult to hike just long if you go all the way. This trail is not a loop so you will have to double back or you could park another car at the other end. Stay on the river to river trail there are a couple spur trails just after starting. The cache is a regular size lock n lock box painted to match surroundings and filled with the usual trinkets, log book and pen. Cache is about 2miles in and close to the trail. Bring water and bug spray.
The trail is frequently used and maintained, you will might meet horseback riders so yield the right of way to them.

Located in western Union County, the Bald Knob Wilderness covers over 5,800 acres making it the largest designated wilderness area in Illinois. A lonely unpaved road separates the Bald Knob Wilderness area with the Clear Springs Wilderness area to the west. The area here and in the Pine Hills further west are home to some of the most diverse plant life in the United States.

Godwin Trail runs from Bald Knob hill on the eastern end past Hutchins Creek into steeper topography finally ending at the Clear Springs Wilderness Area. The trail totals about five miles. The trailhead is along the road leading from the town of Alto Pass to the top of Bald Knob. A small parking area and trailhead are on the right side of the road. Godwin Trail ends at the road separating the two wildernesses, but since the trail is part of the River to River Trail it follows the road into the Clear Springs Wilderness to the west.

The National Forest Service uses the following marker to designate trails in the Shawnee National Forest. Not all trails in all areas are marked with these though. This trail uses [White Diamond with blue &apos;i&apos; = River to River Trail ]

Saw the creature from the lagoon hanging out here.  Decide to hike another .4 mile to Hutchinson Creek.  It wasn&apos;t flowing, but a good sidetrip since we were so close anyway.  Thanks again PomonaCachers for planting some &quot;hikeable&quot; caches.

Cache ID: GC1Y5CQ
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: Be on the lookout,  Strange things have been reported!
Murphysboro Big Muddy Monster

As reported by &quot;Unknown Creatures&quot;: This creature seems to be a living &apos;swamp thing&apos; the character in the old tv series and movie. In documented sighting reports the monster is described as a lumbering hulk, roughly 6 feet tall and wide, like a very big boned man. The creature is covered with fur that is a dirty brownish color, the fur is always covered and matted with mud and pieces of plants and leaves. The creature appears to weigh around 200 lbs. The creatures eyes glow a pinkish-red color. 
The creature was always sighted near what is called &apos;the big muddy&apos; river. 

First reported in 1973,  the story of the Big Muddy Monster has intrigued many through the years. Still today, there are places along the big muddy river that if your quiet and patient enough you may catch a glimpse of, or hear and the weird shrieks of the &quot;Big Muddy Monster.&quot;


The Cache, a roundlays container painted to match its surroundings, is located just off a boat access point to the Big Muddy river.  Be advised that this location floods yearly, especially during the Spring&apos;s rainy season  but the cache is located high enough to hopefully avoid being swept down the river.
Hint: About eye level where squirrels play.

It was neat to see how high the river was.  Last Sunday I went canoeing up the Big Muddy and they up Crab Orchard Creek.  It was really neat being on the river in flood stage!  This helped  me guage how high the river was.

2009-11-07 TsukiakariUsagi, So today was a journey to break a lot of personal records... 1 day, 1 city, 31 caches bookmarked, 9 hours of daylight (8:15am - 5:15pm)... After it was all said and down, there were 23 total attempts at caches, 17 of those were found, 4 were DNF&apos;s, and 2 were noted due to various circumstances. The following is a story of one of those caches:
-----
This was supposed to be my fifteenth cache of the day;  however, as you can see by the photograph, the Big Muddy River has still not stopped it&apos;s relentless attack from the flood over a week ago.  It&apos;s gone down some, but it hasn&apos;t gone down enough, and not far from the water line, I could see what seems to be a rather swift current, so I did not want to chance wading it for a cache.  I&apos;ll just add this to my list of caches that I come back later for.
Write note
2009-11-01 Team Nosoman, The road and parking lot are now under water.  With all the rain, it was expected.  Didn&apos;t even try for it, would have needed a boat.  I think the cache hide was well above the water line.  We will try for it again another time.  TFTC

The stories of the Knights Templar, Knights Hospitaller and the
Teutonic Knights are the stuff of legends. These Knights had
different causes or came from different lands, but had some things
in common. Their faith was one of these. All of these orders had
Temples or Chapels to turn to when not defending or helping care
for the less fortunate. Another was that most Knights spoke a
common language in addition to their native tongue. 
Recently I have come across an encrypted letter leading to one
of these temple/chapels. The legend states that a Knight has hidden
a treasure for the first to decipher the following; 
Occasus zephirum octo octo quinque quinque octo novem octo
Aquilo tres septem quattour quattour quinque novem quattour

Cache ID: GCK9B0
Multi-cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T1.5
DESC: Take a scenic diversion through the eastern Ozarks.
This easy five-part multi provides a welcome diversion for geocachers traveling north on Interstate 55 in Missouri. Visit some interesting road cuts and learn about the geology south of St. Louis along a 40-mile stretch between Perryville and Festus. 

All the stops are close to exits, but you won?t have to park your car, or walk, on the interstate to view them. At Stops 1 through 3 you?ll be looking for an orange plastic matchbox. Note the special instructions at Stop 4. Each contains information you?ll need to find the regular cache at Stop 5. 

STOP 1: PERRYVILLE (N 37º 43.657?, W 89º 54.210?)

Take Perryville exit 129 (MO Rt 51). Turn left (south) on MO 51 and cross over I-55. Immediately after crossing over I-55 turn right (north) on Lake Drive. Go 1.48 miles north on Lake Drive and park on shoulder. You are standing on the Joachim Dolomite, an Ordivician rock unit that is about 450 million years old. It has some good shell fossils.

Get back on I-55 North and proceed 11 miles to exit 141. Between here and the next stop you?ll see mostly two rock units. The Joachim is visible on the hills. In the valleys you?ll see the St. Peter Sandstone, which lies beneath the Joachim.

STOP 2: FAULT ZONE (N 37º 50.841?, W 90º 00.122?)

Take exit 141 (State Rt Z). Turn right (east) on Z and park on the shoulder. Walk to the road cut on the east side of I-55. The clue is here.

This is an exposure of St. Peter Sandstone, which is described in greater detail at Stop 5. This cut is significant because it exposes the Ste. Genevieve fault zone, a major branch of the New Madrid fault system. This fault has been mapped for a distance of 125 miles, from St. Clair, Missouri to Anna, Illinois. I-55 crosses the fault at the Route Z overpass, where jumbled blocks of the St. Peter lie at various angles. When you find the clue, you?ll be standing right on the fault.

Just a quarter mile to the north, undisturbed beds of the much younger Burlington and Keokuk formations are exposed. All of the Silurian, Devonian and upper Ordovician units that should be here are missing, the result of millions of years of erosion. This represents a vertical displacement of about 1,800 feet.

There are lots of shell fossils in these rocks. At one time (about 500 million years ago) this was a tropical island beach with sparkling white sand and azure seas filled with clams, weird bugs and corals. There were no fish in the seas and no trees on the land ? just moss and maybe grasses.

At this point I invite you take a short side trip through some of the most beautiful and historic country in southern Missouri. It?s a combination of the Ozark mountains and the Mississippi River hill country. You can, of course, get back on I-55 and exit at the appropriate spots to find the clues, but the following descriptions presume that you are taking the back roads described below.

Go east on Rt Z to US61 north and enter the village of St. Marys. This is an old farming town that?s seen better days. On the east (right) side of US61 is the floodplain of the Mississippi River, some of the richest farmland in the country. There are some nice historic homes here. For you out-of-staters, Missouri and Wisconsin are the only states I know of that use letter designations for secondary (county) highways. What makes it confusing, in Missouri anyway, is that every county in the state probably has a Rt Z, a Rt H, etc. Keep that in mind as you roam the Ozark hills.

STOP 3: LIME KILN ROAD (N 37º 58.407?, W 90º 05.208?)

Stay on US61 north through Ste. Genevieve, pass the Mississippi Lime Company plant, then turn left (south) on Lime Kiln Road (intersection is at N37° 58.740&apos;, W90° 4.723&apos;). Go about 0.65 miles and stop at the chalky white limestone road cuts. This is the Salem Limestone, +98% pure calcium carbonate. It is cross-bedded and oolitic, which means it is composed mainly of tiny round carbonate grains, smaller than the head of a pin. These are the same beds that Mississippi Lime mines to produce quicklime and ground limestone that goes into foods and pharmaceuticals. If you?ve ever taken a Tums tablet, you have eaten some of the rocks you are looking at now ? bon apetit! 

To continue to Stop 4, go back to US61 and turn left (north). Drive 10.76 miles, through the village of Bloomsdale. I would be doing you a disservice, however, if I didn?t invite you to spend an hour or so in beautiful, historic Ste. Genevieve. To get downtown, go back to the Mississippi Lime Company plant entrance, but turn the opposite direction (east) on Market Street, then follow it downtown.

Founded in 1735, Ste. Genevieve was settled by lead miners, farmers and fur traders and the French influence is visible everywhere you look. Visit the Great River Road Interpretive Center, on South Main Street, or tour the historic Church of Ste. Genevieve to learn about the area?s fascinating history. The Ste. Genevieve Museum contains varied collections of local memorabilia, including prehistoric Indian relics, old documents and Spanish land grants.

Historic homes provide a glimpse into the pioneer spirit of the city&apos;s earliest settlers.  The Guibourd-Valle House was built about the 1784&apos;s by a pioneer French settler.  Handsomely restored, it is the most elegantly furnished museum house in town. The Felix Valle State Historic Site, built in 1818, was home to one of Ste.Genevieve&apos;s premier colonial families. This important Federal style limestone building features the authentically restocked mercantile store of the historic trading firm of Menard &amp; Valle. The Bolduc House, built in 1770, is regarded as the first, most authentically restored creole house in the nation. There are also several nice family restaurants downtown. 

STOP 4: FOURCHE DU CLOS (N 38º 01.311?, W 90º 13.989?):

Welcome to the Fourche a du Clos Roadside Park in the village of Bloomsdale. I picked this spot more for the great view than for the geology. You are looking up the valley of Fourche du Clos Creek. There is a granite elevation marker here ? a good place to check the altitude accuracy of your GPS.

Muggles seem to be watching this stop, probably from across the road. My container keeps disappearing, so I&apos;m changing this to a virtual clue. Find the elevation marker. Add the three numbers, then divide the sum by two (example: if the elevation is 684, then 6 + 8 + 4 = 18. 18/2 = 9. The value for Clue D would be 9).

You are standing on the Joachim Dolomite. A few hundred feet north of this park on US 61 there is a good exposure of Joachim in a road cut. Further north, you pass through the Joachim into the underlying St. Peter Sandstone.Proceed north on US61 for 12.80 miles to the cache.

STOP 5: CACHE (N 38º 09.AB2, W 90º 21.CD3)

Now you?ve visited four great road cuts and collected the clues that will take you to the cache! Take the numbers you?ve been writing down and substitute them for the appropriate letters in the cache coordinates. About 200 ft before I-55 exit #170, then turn right (north) on Cement Plant Rd. Go 0.3 mi north on Cement Plant Rd to Castle Acres Rd. The cache is about 0.4 mi NW of this intersection. Castle Acres is a dead end road, so you?ll have to retrace your steps back to I-55, then you?ll be on your way again.

CHECKSUM: 09.AB2 + 21.CD3 = 31.735

As you approach I-55 (exit 170) you?ll pass through a great exposure of St. Peter Sandstone (N38° 9.435&apos;, W90° 21.124&apos;). This is a good place to stop if you want to get a close look at the St. Peter. Note that you can easily break small chunks of this sandstone with your fingers. That?s because it is almost pure silica sand with very weak clay cement holding the grains together. Nearby Crystal City got its name from the plate glass factories that have operated here since the late 1860s. The glass is made from the same clean silica sandstone that you see here.

BONUS: email me with a one-word description of the red stamp on each clue to claim your bonus find! At Stop 4 send me the elevation on the granite marker.

2008-01-31 CDS231, Thought I would take a chance today with the weather and go south in Illinois and Missouri. It worked out well with the snow not causing any major problems locating any caches or delaying me on the trip back home.

I went all of the way south and completed this on my way north. A couple of the waypoints proved to be stubborn and waypoint # 4 was snow covered. Thanks for the check sums as I was able to finally figure it out with the process of elimination. Had a couple of inches of snow the last 30 miles home but no problems for me. Did see several accidents and several cars off of the road.

Thanks Know Future this was a very enjoyable cache.

2007-11-30 JanS03, Caching with IBEW Ret on a rather cool day.  First we headed southeast to Red Bud, then Sparta, crossed into Missouri at Chester, and headed to Perryville, then north again doing the caches in each area along the way.  They were all a lot of fun, and we found all we searched for today.  
Finally got a chance to go for this one today.  We were in the general area for a few other caches and were heading north anyway, and what better way to make a trip go by quickly than to hunt caches along the way.  Didn&apos;t have any problems finding any of the waypoints, but I was confused about info given for Stop 4 and we had to make a slight change to find the final.  Thanks Know Future!

 <desc>Tunnel Hill by GEO.JOE
Cache ID: GCHVJ1
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.0/T1.5
DESC: This cache is placed along the Tunnel Hill State Trail at Tunnel
Hill IL.
Access to the cache is by an easy .60 mile walk from the Tunnel
Hill parking/access area on a converted Rail-to-Trail day-use
(hiking/biking)trail. The cache can not be reached by wheelchair
bound cachers but the trail is suitable for wheelchair travel. 

At one time, the rumble of freight cars reverberated through the
narrow tunnel at Tunnel Hill. Today, the railroad is gone and the
route known as Tunnel Hill State Trail remains. For more than 50
years after the railroad was built, the tunnel was longer than 800
feet, but when a portion of the tunnel collapsed in 1929, the
landmark was shortened by 300 feet. Now 543-feet long, it is the
only tunnel on the trail. The tunnel is located 1/4 mile south of
Tunnel Hill on the trail toward Vienna.Tunnel Hill State Trail
stretches for 45 miles from Harrisburg to Karnak, The trail at
Harrisburg begins in flat farm country. At New Castle, the old
railroad bed enters the Shawnee National Forest, remaining there
for roughly half of the trial&apos;s length. By New Burnside, it&apos;s among
bluffs, and south of Vienna it passes through a lush wetland. At
Karnak, it emerges from the Cache River State Natural Area&apos;s
ancient cypress-tupelo swamp.

Interesting walk before hitting the woods. Kept looking for snakes basking in the sun. Not today...In the woods now and geared up a much needed WRT. Hit the creek and bone dry. Hit GZ and was a little concerned. Soooo many places for the cache to be hidden. Had not seen any pics. But the cache is large enough so just a little effort and it will be found. I enjoyed the area and sat and rested a spell before continuing on. Thanks GJ...Have to find yer sweetie now.

We started out at about 3:30pm and did not get out until 8:00pm, It got dark on us cause we were having fun exploring the area and lots of trees were down from the ice several weeks ago. We actually got turned around a little bit in the dark, We did not have much light small flashlight and a Triton 2000. I will be back here this summer to do some camping.

 <sym>Traditional Cache</sym>
 <desc>Sand Cave by GEO.JOE
Cache ID: GCK82Y
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T2.5
DESC: Sand Cave is North America&apos;s largest sandstone cave.
This is one of Southern Illinois&apos; many hidden treasures. Sandstone
caves typically consist of shelters at the base of bluffs. This is
one of the few sandstone caves you will encounter with an arched
entrance and a dome shaped room roughly 100 feet in circumstance.
The cave is thought to have been occupied by Native Americans for
around 12,000 years. Evidence of their living situations are still
apparent. Sand Cave also has a link to the Underground Railroad.
Escaped slaves from the south would make their way to the nearby
black community of Miller Grove where residents would hide them at
Sand Cave. 

To reach the cave is an easy 1/2 mile walk on a shared
hiking/equestrian trail, easily negotiated with a stroller with
large wheels. to reach the cache is just a walk in the woods. There
are many great boulders to climb on near the cache. Also be sure to
explore the area north of the cave along the bluff, very neat area
with lots of places to climb around. **The cache now has a coin
exchange in it so please trade fair - Coin for Coin, For those that
do not know a 1951 Franklin Half is not equal to two KY quarters!**


Directions: From the intersection of Illinois 147 and Illinois 145
follow Illinois 147 West .25 mile to Cedar Grove Church Rd. Turn
North onto Cedar Grove Church Rd, and drive 3.8 miles to Sand Cave
road just before the Cedar Grove Church. Turn West and drive 0.2
miles. You are able to park at the trail head N37 30.064 W88
38.607. Expect to be greeted by the neighborhood dogs. They bark
but they are all friendly and listen well when told to get
back.

2009-11-09 sun-moon-starz, Enjoyed driving through southern IL with budophylus on a fair fall day. This definitely was one of our most memorable IL finds ever as we thoroughly searched the area. I got some nice pictures of the cave and did work hard for the find. They always seem so simple once found, but there were some frustrated moments on this one as the coordinates get wonky near the cliff. Bud &amp; I loved the &quot;old-school&quot; caching adventure here for sure! Thanks so much for the awesome cache.
Found it
2009-11-09 budophylus, Our last Illinois find of the day, and one of our most memorable, if only because we took the wrong route initially.  After starting up with a greeting from the neighbor dogs and their owner, we set off for the cache site.  It was my bright idea to take off up the hill when we got .14 away, and head straight for the coordinates.  Big mistake, but we did get to take a very picturesque walk around the top of the plateau before we got back down to the trail to head around the right way.  Once we got to the site, we were amazed at the cave, and wouldn&apos;t have believed that this was Illinois if we didn&apos;t know where we were.  Sun-moon-starz made the find while I was climbing and looking in the wrong spot.  Thanks for the cache, and keeping old-style caching alive!

2009-05-17 regnad, Darua, Ethan and I met up with Geo.Joe, Fairy Flirt, Mikeatnight, Jeanie, Billy, Tina, Brent, Debbie, Dustin, and Brittany in Paducah today to come up and explore the area around here and over around Burden Falls.  The weather was absolutely beautiful with temperatures hovering around the upper 60s to low 70s.  We spent about two hours exploring the cave and surrounding bluffs.  This was the first time for several in our group to experience geocaching so we spent a few minutes showing them the ropes and watching while they hunted for the cache.  After signing the log, we hiked back out and headed on down the road toward Burden Falls.  Again, we spent several hours exploring the falls and surrounding bluffs there.  After climbing all over and under the rocks, bluffs, and creek, we were pretty worn out.  We ended up venturing over toward Vienna for a late dinner.

All in all, it was a great day and I&apos;m glad we decided to tag along at the last minute.  We just may find ourselves back up here in a couple of weeks for the RVG Spring Campout.

2009-05-09 GEO.JOE, We dropped off a pen. I should have checked the pens before I left the house. I arrived at the cache with 4 pens and the first 3 I checked did not work : ) Luckily the forth came alive and I was able to leave it. Fairy Flirt and I then walked through the rockfall and along the bluff north of the cave. I sure hope everyone that visits takes the time to check this area out. The moss, ferns and other vegetation was very lush and green today. We also saw a humming bird at a small waterfall (the 3rd one I have ever seen in the wild ;  )
We also got distracted for about 45 min watching skinks and lizards on a fallen tree. I saw the largest and darkest Fence Lizard I have ever seen. It was a great day.

2009-05-02 catdad, Another cool cache by GEO JOE.

I followed the trail to the cave after reading Solarwib&apos;s log. I looked around the cave for a few minutes, very interesting place, it’s amazing what is in our own backyard. Went on to find the cache and check out some waterfalls. On my return trip I ran into some horse riders at the cave and helped them with a group picture. Then went on my way, thanks Joe. 

p.s. I broke the cardinal rule of Geocaching. I walked in to the cache and didn’t take a pen or pencil, and the one in the cache was missing. So I signed with a muddy thumb print. I will return in a couple weeks and sign it proper and leave some pens.

2009-04-27 solarwib, I was hoping to find a cache in Pope county today.  I didn&apos;t like me first choice so I checked what was closest.  I decided on this one.  I found the parking easy enough and started off down the trail.  I know Joe said it was an easy walk down the trail even baby strollers could make the trip.  My mistake was checking the gps.  The arrow pointed over that way and I was getting farther away.  So like always I abandon the trail and start following the arrow.  I got pretty close sort of, if you don&apos;t count the vertical distance.  So it seems that the moral of this story is &apos;Trust in the Joe&apos; (say it with an Obi-Wan Kenobi voice)
I went back down and followed the trail and checked out the cave for a little bit.  I found the cache and two other people had found it today.
I changed my plans midstream so I ended up caching in four states today.

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T3.0
DESC: Located in Ghost Dance Canyon at Dixon Springs State Park. This is
a Native American and Animal themed cache, so please trade items
related to the theme.
**5-11-09 - Clean up from the winter ice storm of 09 is still
underway in the park but they still have not gotten to the trails.
The park is back open but with signs at the entrance, playground,
picnic area, campground and trail heads that read : CAUTION: Storm
damage has created hanging and broken limbs within the area, these
may fall at any time. ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!&quot;** 
 
 Ghost Dance Canyon is a very scenic area with a lot to see in a
short distance. The canyon is only about ½ mile long with a boulder
strewn stream through the middle and bordered by 30 foot tall
cliffs. Gigantic boulders are perched along the hillside and in the
spring the tops of the boulders are ablaze with wild flowers.
Shelter caves, seasonal waterfalls and various plant and animal
life can also be seen throughout the canyon. Dixon Springs has been
home to various Native American tribes and was known to the Shawnee
as &quot;Kitchemuske-nee-be&quot; or the Great Medicine Waters. I have
provided items in the cache related to animals and the powers
Native Americans attributed to the animals. Spend some time
enjoying the view of the canyon and reading the materials I have
placed in the cache. Please do not removed any of the books or
information cards from the cache box and bring a trade item that is
Native American or animal related. 

The area I have chosen for the cache is perched high above the
canyon and in the winter and spring, when the leaves are off the
trees, it offers a peaceful spot to view most of the canyon. There
is some climbing required to reach this cache and depending on your
approach you may encounter steep elevation changes. You will have
to climb through a crack about 10 feet high to reach the top of a
boulder, (It was negotiated easily by my 7 year old cousin). There
is a large area to walk around once on top but keep in mind it is
40 feet from the ground on all other sides of the boulder(There is
no need to get close to the 40 foot edge to find the cache). Each
side of the canyon offer it?s own areas of interest and so does the
creek itself. Some points of interest include a big tree N37 22.816
W88 40.491 and boulders in the creek N37 22.816 W88 40.491. Plan to
spend some time exploring the canyon and enjoying the rest of the
park.

More EXCELLENCE in caching.  Found a bit of a trail heading towards the cache that just ended about .2 short.  Into some pretty thick bushwhack with rain starting up again.  Finally broke thru to some really nice views and steep drop offs.  Seemed we cant get there from here so wandered and explored some alternate approaches until be found the right level.  Superbly well placed.  Can say no more.  Amazing!  Now were caching!  Took a beautiful alternate route back that had everything one could want for a nice hike, beautiful fall color, small waterfall, terrain changes, water crossing, the whole package.  GREAT CACHE!!!  TFTC!  Also came across a basketball sized hen of the woods mushroom.  Left for a future finder as we&apos;ll not be home for a couple days and no way to transport it.

2009-08-08 Witless, Wow - This turned out to be the toughest on our sweep through S IL. Traveling was difficult due to the number of trees that are down across the paths. Had to backtrack a bit once it became apparent we were on the wrong side of the canyon. One of the party took a spill in the creek as we crossed over to the other side. We decided we would try to stay at the higher elevation but ended up having to climb down before climbing back up. Once on top at GZ, a little bit of searching soon turned up the cache. Cache is in good shape and signed log. It was I who slipped in the creek on the way back! Thanks for the adventure and I hope there are more visitors to this little gem.

 This trail is the least traveled trail within the park. Therefore,
you will likely have this area all to yourself to explore to your
heart&apos;s content. Wildlife is prevalent on this trail. I have not
been on this trail without seeing deer, squirrel, lizards, toads,
birds or tree frogs. Also during a rain or shortly after there are
dozens of spots that water cascades from the low bluffs, however,
you must be there during or after a rain to see the water flowing
off the bluffs.


Tips: From the trail the cache is well above your head and GPS
accuracy is about 50 to 80 feet. There is no need to go to the top
of the bluffs to reach this cache but I do use the neat little tree
growing out of the bluff with 3 vertical limbs. 

The Bluff Trail is accessed by the Pine Tree Trail at the primitive
campground N37 23.098 W88 39.929 and is about a 1.5 mile loop on
mostly manicured trail until it gets to the creek below the bluffs.
After you have found the cache and you still want to explore you
can easily access the top of the bluffs at N37 23.368 W88 39.471 to
enjoy the lichen covered sandstone barren.

2009-09-13 Second Hand Lion, Pope.  This was a little bit longer of a hike than I had thought it&apos;d be and after over exerting myself yesterday I was thinking twice about it.  But hey!  I made it and I found it!  Yea!  Thanks for placing the cache!

2009-06-08 tubaman67, Could not find the trail that I needed to.  Went down a road and GPS said to go through someones driveway and yard so I turned around.  Will go back and find this one.
Found it
2009-06-02 Malacandra, Dad Buetracker and some friends went after this one. The rest of the Buetrackers chose swimming on this hot afternoon. We were on a retreat at the State Park. 

We hiked along the trail which was rutted and muddy in several spots. We found the cache easily enough, though the trail was well clogged with downed trees and branches. Found one of the strangest things I&apos;ve ever seen in a cache, a small paper back about &quot;Moral Re-Armament.&quot; Some kind of little propaganda book. Funny! 

We got a brief thunder shower on the return trip. There were loads of ticks on this trail, too! TN, Left a slip of paper with the logo for our &quot;Gregorian Chant Retreat.&quot; TFTC

2009-05-12 GEO.JOE, Clean up from the winter ice storm of 09 is still underway in the park but they still have not gotten to the trails. The park is back open but with signs at the entrance, playground, picnic area, campground and trail heads that read : CAUTION: Storm damage has created hanging and broken limbs within the area, these may fall at any time.  ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!&quot;
So there you go, it is no longer closed but they do ask that you take caution and watch out for dangerous areas.

2009-04-14 GEO.JOE, Trails at Dixon Springs SP are still closed due to tree damage from the Jan. Ice Storm.

9/22/04 ,10/8/06   muggled!!!   hopefully not geo-muggles.
moved cache to new location.  no hint.  just use gps.
real reason for this cache is to share beauty of area with
others,  so sign log, take nothing, leave nothing. log
your comments here,  
come explore this spot, follow bluffs on west for more
shelter bluffs and rock formations. go south about 150 yds and you can explore along the top of a low bluff line with pretty decent views in winter.

rivertorivertrail.com, click on banner for hiking schedule.
this spot is a midpoint on the three arches trail hike,
come on out and join us for a hike sometime.

this was a meeting place during Civil War for the Knights of the Golden Circle. Southern sympathizers with ties to the &quot;Copperheads&quot; and possibly part of the reverse underground railroad. lots of history in this area and a really nice area to explore. park at 37.36440, 88.21802 go north west to take the low trail below bluffs, go thru archway , head south . plastic food container with log book. locals camp
and party here so take a trash bag. lots of poison ivy and cliffs, so watch your step and supervise the little ones, stay on trails.

       . Plastic food container with log book, 
muggles or possibly Geo muggles have evidently disturbed this cache twice, i think they were ftf, so it has been moved a short distance .gps co-ord were updated. hope you find it. the real reason for putting a cache here is to share the beauty of this area with others. come on out and look for it, then spend some time exploring the bluffs . go north on trail under bluff for some real neat caves etc. follow trail n or east to circle around up on top of Buzzard Point. go to N37.36.123 W088.21.545 to scramble up
a steep rocky slope to get on top.

DESC: high knob once was site of a fire tower,located on a 900 ft tall hill just east of garden of the gods.
turn north in karbers ridge , 2 miles to high knob.looks like you are entering a horse camp. drive on thru on main gravel and follow road up the hill. great view and picnic area.usually not as crowded as Garden of the Gods. all that is left of tower is 4 small concrete bases.
 great trail starts on south side of open area , on your left as you drive up and follows around base of the bluffs, and comes back to parking lot from the North end by the &quot;privy&quot;, trail is very scenic, must explore this!! 
  usgs benchmark about 125ft s of old tower base.
     Rivertorivertrail.com   trail crosses access road just before you get to top of hill. can follow it on to buzzard point( about 2.5 mile) and to garden of gods( 1.5 mile more).
camo food container with logbook,pencil.lots of geomuggles in area so i reccomend tnlnsl just enjoy the view.!!!
   if you want a view from a fire tower, check out Trigg Tower between Eddyville,Ozark,Tunnel Hill.closest tower
that i know of that is still open to public. well worth the
drive and climb while it&apos;s still available. the Forest Service may quit maintaining it one of these days!!

There is a lot of history here dating back at least 150 years.  Even though I am still an amateur geocacher I felt that this would be a great place for a cache.  This place is beautiful and peaceful, definitely worth seeing and I hope you have a chance to learn a little bit about the history when you visit.  The office staff knows about the cache and would be glad to give you a tour.This is my first hide and would love advice from the professionals.

DESC: This cache is located on the northern part of Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. It is on the Canal Loop Trail that is for mountain bikers and hikers both.
This area needs a cache and this spot is a very nice place. The Canal Loop trail is 11.2 miles in lenght. It makes for a good hour to 2 hour ride for mountain bikers. It contains 4 connector trails, so you can turn it into a longer or shorter ride. The same for hikers, a hiker could do a section of the trail with these connector trails, or put 2 or 3 sections together and make for a great hike. The main place to park is the North Welcome Station. The trail crosses roads at several locations and any of these access are OK too. Using the roads in the area, you can get relatively close to the cache. The cache site is a good place to rest and enjoy the veiw. Specil thanks to CashAdvance, a fellow geocacher, who made it possible for us to maintain this site.

DESC: On rare occasions Mother Nature allows us a view of the earth&apos;s inner plumbing system.
Schnurbusch Karst Window is located on the grounds of St. Joseph&apos;s Catholic Church in the village of Apple Creek, which was formerly Schnurbusch. A side of a fairly shallow sinkhole opens allowing spring water to flow over a scenic ledge, creating a small waterfall. The water turns and flows under a walking bridge and then re-enters the earth through a swallow hole. The Church has developed the area into a well-maintained, relaxing amphitheatre appropriate for meditation and reflection.

Although the area is open to the public, please respect any services that are being held, either in the church or the amphitheatre. Leave quietly, and come back at a more convenient time.

Enjoy this area. The church and cemetery are both worth a little extra time.

I just ask that you email the date that the altar was erected in the natural amphitheatre before you log your find. It&apos;s located over the little bridge at the karst window. Enjoy.

2009-07-10 Monkeybrad, Very cool spot, we enjoyed checking out the area.  So what were we doing here in the first place? Well, my wife, Scoot the Frog and I usually take a spring/summer roadtrip with friends to attend GeoWoodstock, but since we had the great honor of being the hosts this year we missed out on our trip. To make it up to her, we set out from Tennessee on a two week, nearly 5,000 mile trip, caching, camping and hiking our way out the the southwest and back. We stayed mainly off the interstates and tried to travel the old roads as much as we could, following a route that took us on Route 66, Old Highway 50 and the Great River Road. Over those 14 days we found caches in 12 states and had a great time exploring the beauty and the hidden treasures of our great country. Thank you for taking the time to place this cache we enjoyed the hunt and our adventure.

Check here for current river levels. I think you will need the guage height under ZERO FEET in order to not get wet when retrieving the cache. &quot;Mississippi River level at Chester&quot;

Cache is not appropriate for small kids and dogs due to the nature of the approach. 

Had trouble getting a good satellite lock, so alternate coordinates are 37 37.925, 089 30.873 (maybe). Please advise of coordinates. 

Take a picture of yourself with the camera but please don&apos;t take the camera.

2009-09-27 teambarrgram, we have had four cachers and two non-cachers on three seperate visits look for this cache.  After today, I am loggiing that the cache is missing.  However, we left a new ammo box cache at the rock. the new coords are in catdad&apos;s log.  Since we have left the replacement cache, we are logging the find.  The water was up today and a little rough but we tied up easy.  We did have a mishap with dochawg, he fell and is a little sore but OK. Will post pics later.

2009-09-27 catdad,  What a way to start a day of caching. We arrived by boat because the river will just not cooperate. I have waited almost 2 years for the water level to drop and walk out. So the offer from Teambarrgram and crew to take a boat ride couldn’t be refused. 
 We looked for the original, but it was gone, in it’s place we found a replacement cache at coordinates N37* 37.912  W 089* 30.877. The view was great and the history of this Rock makes it a “must do cache”.  

Thanks for placing a cache here!

Thanks to Teambarrgram, Dochawg and 1bgjake for the ride out. Dochawg, hope you&apos;re OK. That had to hurt!

I keep hearing that the cache needs maintenance or is missing but unless you know where the cache is (was) how do you know it is missing ?
Didn&apos;t find it

Didn&apos;t find it
2009-09-12 teambarrgram, I believe 99% that this cache is missing. We searched the entire top of the rock and several times where the GPS took us with coords.  Went with BigJake and dochawg. We tool lots of pics that we will post but, no cache.  I called Cav Scout for a clue but he informed us that there were people on top of the rock at the same time they were there and he believes the cache was muggled after him and joranda left. We are going back out next week and will take a replacement ammo box cache if that is alright with the owners.

2009-09-05 joranda, What a crazy trip this was. We started the day at the Murphysboro event. Once we got all the caches done we decided to take the kayaks down to the Mississippi River to go after the cache. We didn&apos;t have time to go to the Missouri side of the river so we put in across from the island on the Illinois side. It started as a easy crossing until we got about half way and the current picked up pretty quickly. The plan was to across it at a up river angle so we wouldn&apos;t miss the island but that quickly changed when we hit the current. At that time it looked like the island was moving as we paddled toward it but it was us starting to lose the battle. Once we was toward the back of the island we had to paddle hard to gain on it with any hope not to miss our landing. About thirty feet or so from the island we started seeing small whirl pools here and there which was freaky, later I learned it could of been a bad thing if we got pulled into one. Finally what seemed like forever, we landed on the side of the islnad facing Illinois. Once we had the kayaks safely pulled up on the rocks we started checking out the island. I feel like I climbed every square inch of the island. We found a rope tied to a tree on the edge of the top of the island that looked like it was used to help get to the top but it really didn&apos;t need to be used. The vegatation on top was crazy thick which made moving around hard. I really enjoyed this adventure and I would tell the next people who come here is not to try and cross from the Illinois side cause it is too dangerous and crazy. Even the paddle back was just as crazy. Thanks for placing this cache. It was a hell of a adventure. I will post some photos of the adventure.

     This is a two step cache. The original coordinates will bring you to a place where the answers to the following questions can be found. Then simply insert the missing numbers in the coordinates below, and it will lead you to the hidden cache.  It was our intention that you visit and enjoy, as well as learn from the original site, and for that reason the actual cache location is close enough that you will not need to get back in your car to find it.  Hopefully, that will give you plenty of time to enjoy this unique place.

Cache ID: GCHD8M
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T2.0
DESC: The cache is on a little known bird watching loop trail that is
adjacent to Perkins Creek at Paducah&apos;s Noble Park.
The Bird Trail is located in the northwest corner of Bob Noble
Park. The trail is accessed by walking along and crossing over the
earthen flood wall on the west side of the park. There are no signs
leading to the trail, however, the trail heads are easily visible
from the top of the flood wall. The trail is minimally maintained,
so expect fallen trees across the trail. In the spring and during
periods of heavy rain a natural pond forms in the center of the
bird trail loop, and a section of the trail, 80 feet north of the
cache, will become muddy or have water runoff from the pond,
therefore the southern trail head would be best during periods of
wet weather.

DESC: This is an easy cache for a hot day, be ready for a nice swim when
you are done. Amidon is a beautiful place, and the view from the
cache is nice. Don&apos;t bring any glass, $250.00 fine per bottle. The
whole trail is about 1 mile, you will pass within about 25 &apos; of the
cache if you stay on the trail.
This cache is near the top of the hill over the Castor River.
Follow the path to the Shut-ins, then on down the marked path
towards the cache. Stay on the path until you are near the cache.
As you are standing looking out over the valley, and taking in the
fantastic view, you will see a drop off of about 8 feet. As you
stand near this drop off, you will see a pile of rocks on top of a
short stump down below. The cache is within 10&apos; of this pile of
rocks. This cache has been moved over 100&apos; and is now reloggable.

DESC: Third in a series of four caches named and placed by my children.
Apple Creek Conservation Area in northeasten Cape Girardeau county is the location for this cache. Steep hills and narrow valleys characterize this area of 2,082 acres. 
There is a state maintained shooting range for rifle, shotgun, handgun, and archery. Bring your own paper targets if you are interested. This is a popular place for shooting enthusiasts, so get there early in the morning if you are going to visit on a weekend. The cache is nowhere near the shooting range, so no need to worry......
Anyway, here&apos;s how to get there. Take the Fruitland exit off I-55 and travel north on HWY 61. Turn right on county road C. Follow C until you come to CC and make a right ( there is a sign for Apple Creek at this intersection ).Follow the signs from that point. 





Hint: Follow CC to the Fishing Access area. Park at the access, get a map, and follow the trail. Go through the metal gate to your right. Follow this trail always staying to the left. Cache is in a cut tree stump about 25 feet off the trail on your left.

ROAD TURNED AND CURVED SO MUCH THAT IT WAS NOTHING FOR THE GPS TO READ APPROX 4.5 MILES FOR QUITE SOME TIME...GOING UP A BIT THEN DOWN A BIT. TURNED AROUND WHEN WE THOUGHT WE PASSED THE BEST WAY TO THE CACHE AND TOOK A ROAD THAT READ &quot;HORSE TRAILER PARKING&quot;. THAT WAS A DEAD END WITH ABOUT 2.5 MILES LEFT TO THE CACHE. ANYWAY...THE 3 JUNIOR CACHER&apos;S WERE GROWING QUITE TIRED OF BEING IN THE CAR SO WE HEADED BACK TO TOWN.

DESC: Fort Defiance Park--Confluence of America.  This is where the Mighty Mississippi and Ohio rivers actually meet together, and was the sight of &quot;Fort Defiance&quot; during the Civil War.  If you have never visited this park before, stop by for a quick visit!  Be sure to hold onto your hat, as it is VERY windy here with these incredible rivers rushing by!
Fort Defiance was established at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to thwart the confederate invasion and blockade the trade of the South.  From this spot was launched General Grant&apos;s Great Flanking movement up the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers which began at Fort Henry and ended at Vicksburg, giving the Union complete control of the Mighty Mississippi River.

To Log this cache, e-mail me PRIVATELY the answers to these questions:

1.  How many colors are on the navigational signs?( List number of colors, and which colors)
2.  How many navigational signs are here?
3.  What are the shapes of the signs.  Describe them COMPLETELY to me before you may log this cache.


BE SURE TO ABORT THIS CACHE ATTEMPT IF WATER LEVELS ARE UP, and water is on the road. Additionally, there is a multi cache (by RDW) near this same location called &quot;The BIG Confluence Cache&quot;  If water levels are down--ENJOY!!! http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.asp?ID=18643

Day Three of my northward trek on the Midwest Marauder&apos;s Tour.  I came up I-55 and sloped over to rte 60 to make passage up the mighty confluence of two majestic rivers.  I&apos;ve never been to this spot before, and it was magical.  AS I rounded the corner to the bridge over the Mississippi, The Who was blasting on the radio &quot;I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles&quot;  which was a marvelous accompaniment to the snowy, foggy air that made the bridge appear to fade off into infinity.

2009-11-28 fishallnight, I drive through here a few times each year and stop almost every time just because it is a pretty cool place. It was dark when I was there for the caches and it was a little spooky. Great caches though! I used to spend a lot of time on the river as a kid. Cairo isn&apos;t a great town any more, but this park is still a neat place. Love to look at the rivers at the point they meet. TFTC

2009-07-12 Siamese Retriever, The last time I tried this, I got rained on something fierce.  This time, I had a heck of a time finding a place to park.  But I finally found a spot on the way out.  I spent a good 10 minutes looking for stage 1, and I just can&apos;t find it.  I will be back this way again a few more times in the next few months, so I will have to try it again.  Again!
Needs Maintenance
2009-07-07 Tsnake, In bad condition (wet and smelly).  Also looks like somebody made the decision to place a rogue cache out there.  Owner should clean old cache and remove rogue cache.

2009-07-06 Pharmgal1, Read past log from 6/21 where said they replaced container because couldn&apos;t find original.  We went to bridge, then on with rest of multi-cache, and found our container with last log in May.  We believe it was the original, but it was dumped out and in bad shape.  We put in back together the best we could and signed that log.  We never did find a container with logs from 6/21.  May want to maintenance this one.
Found it
2009-07-06 Tsnake, This was a weird cache for us.  To start off, there were a lot of senior citizens around the starting location.  Once they cleared, we found the coords for the second location.  For a brief moment, we thought about going around to the location by car because it looked like it was off an adjacent road.  Decided to walk over there.  We must have lucked out.  The cache was lying out in the open.  The logbook from Aqua was there, so I am guessing the previous loggers were looking in the wrong location.  Everything was stinking and wet, the cache needs some maintenance.  

Since previous posters have said they placed a new container in the right location, we looked for it but came up empty.  However, the wife did find a letterbox about 50 feet away along the fence.

I think this is the first cache in Paducah! Paducah is my hometown. To log this cache you will have to look around the floodwall for a black transportation object and find the lubricating system on it. When you have located that write down the full name of it. Email me what you find and do not post it in your log! If it is posted in your log I will have to delete your entry.
Make sure to check out the area. Paducah offers TONS! of stuff to do just in probably about 10 blocks of this area.
If I do not email you back about your answer do not get upset I do read everyones comments but I get busy and sometimes forget to answer.

2009-10-20 stoneswivel, My family is from Grand Tower, but when I visit, I never have time to cache.  This time, I made the time for just one, and it was this one.  It was a good choice;  hardly trivial, and appropriately rated.  Dad grew up here, and suggested an easy approach.  He wasn&apos;t wrong;  if it hadn&apos;t been for that storm blowing everything down, it would&apos;ve been.  Saw the easier way at GZ, like always.  Contents are slightly damp, and I&apos;m sorry I didn&apos;t have my repair kit to replace the ziplock for the log.  Perhaps the next finder can help.

DESC: This Cache is located almost on The Maintz wildlife preserve, but not quite.  The terrian is rough, and hilly in some spots.
This is a simple Cache located just barely outside of the Maintz wildlife preserve, in a wooded area.  There is a road leading within a few feet of the cache. I dont recommend using the road as it gets very muddy and soft during wet weather, and it is also private property.  If you choose to drive down the road, you will be doing it at your own risk  There are 2 conservation parking areas a few hundred feet up the road, or you can park on the side of the road and walk.  There are 2 nice stocked ponds on the Conservation area, Be sure to read the rules for amounts of fish that can be caught.

The cache is located on private property, so please do not litter.  Permission granted by land owner.

The cache isn&apos;t all that spectacular, I just thought I would bring you to some nice ponds I have caught lots of fish in, so be sure to bring your fishing gear with you.  Have fun.

I have posted waypoints for a couple of parking lots both are fairly easy walks.  One is mostly on gravel road.  The other one is thru the Conservation department fields.

DESC: This Cache is located on the Maintz conservation area, near Oak Ridge Missouri.  From Jackson Travel highway 72, turn right on Highway B, turn left of highway BB, turn right onto County Road 471.
While I was looking for a place to hide this one, a squirrel, came running after me as I got down to look into a hiding spot.  That is where the name came from.
Maintz Conservation area is open from 4:00 A.M. until 10:00 P.M..  Hunting is allowed, as is fishing in marked ponds and lakes.  If you are into Birdwatching you can also do that.  There is no littering, fireworks, or open fires. 

 There is lots of space to explore while you are there, the area consists of 804 acres.  The cache is in an ammo box, about 1000ft from the parking area.
  Some of the items I left are:

2 sets of golf balls
1 book mark
1 cd holder
1 tavel bug
1 &quot;you might be a redneck&quot;, book
and a few smaller items

The terrain is uneven in many spots, and there are lots of bumps.  There are a few hills, and may be muddy at times.

Geez the sun was down and the wind was a blowing-man was it cold!!!!


OCW K-Team and N0WNV.  Talk about a cold day!!!  And the wind!!  What a day to be caching-we must be insane.  In the teens and 50 mph winds.  Did I mention how cold it was?  We headed down to Perryville and the Cape and had a great and cold time.  Lots of really nice caches.  But it was cold.  Thanks for all the great caches.

There are three different streets you can use to get to this cache. You do not have to walk through the nearby free museum to get to the cache, but you may want to stop there if you have time, since the museum has both permanent and temporary art exhibits as well as scientific and historical ones. I have recieved personal permission from the museum director, but I do not know if the staff have been informed, so watch out for muggles. The cache is a small plastic container, too small for trade items.

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D1.0/T1.0
DESC: This micro is located at the Original Jackson post office. The building is now home to the Chamber of commerce.
The cache is lcated just outside of the Old Jackson post office.  Located in the bulding now is the Jackson Chamber of commerce, and the Jackson License beaurau(that is misspelled)

The Original Jackson post office was buit in 1938.  The Postmaster General at that time was James Farley.  Here is a little useless info on James Farley

James A. Farley was also the first guest on NBC&apos;s Meet the Press, the longest running show in television history

Jim Farley was known for his ability to remember names and details of almost every person he met. He is said to have used the name-picture association method. 

The origainal Architect of the building was Louis Simon, Who apparantly was nationaly know for Post office, and Other federal bulding designs.

Enough Of the silly history, What you are looking for is one of Cape County&apos;s &quot;baby soda bottles&quot; as I have heard them called.  It is located in a very high traffic area with lots of muggles so stealth is a must.  The cache is Located near the sidewalk, and could be handicap accesibled.

Permission granted by Jackson Chamber of commerce

Cache ID: GC10NCF
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: This micro is located at Old Mckendree Chapel
Situated on two pastoral acres in a grove of oak and maple trees, Old McKendree Chapel is regarded as the oldest Protestant church structure standing west of the Mississippi River.
With the thicket of trees providing a good shade and the spring at the base of the rise dispensing refreshing cold water to travelers, this peaceful setting was an ideal location for camp meetings. Mckendree Church was organized in July of 1809 following one of those meetings.




In 1819 skilled workmen built the chapel from huge poplar logs. The first services were held during 1819, and regular church services were held until around 1890. Since then, the chapel has been used for special service such as weddings, baptisms, reunions, and an annual Easter Sunrise Service.


The Chapel has been renovated to its present condition with funds from the District Board of Church Extension. The Chapel is listed in the National Archives of the Methodist Church and the National Register of Historic Places in the United States.

The cache is hidden somewhere out side of the chapel


Winter Hours: 8 am to dusk
Summer Hours: 8 am to 7 pm
Picnic Table and Shelter --- Rest rooms Available

To visit the chapel, from Interstate 55 take exit 99. Turn west onto Highway 61, follow to County Road 307. Turn north, follow to County Road 206. Turn left, the entrance is on the right.


permission was granted by New Mckendree methodist church

If you are in to the letterboxing there is also one of those within a few yards of the cache.  While scouting out a place to put the old Mckendree cemetary cache, the grounds keeper stumbled onto the letterbox. here is the address.

Cache ID: GCTWRC
Unknown Cache
SIZE: Micro
D3.0/T1.0
DESC: Located in North Cape Girardeau, White Oak Trace is part of the
Missouri Department of Conservation Nature Center within North
County Park. The trace features two miles of nature trails over
rolling hills. Farkleberry Knob is off the Ridgetop Trail on the
White Oak Trace. Terrain on Ridgetop Trail meets ADA Standards;  the
paths are smooth asphalt and boardwalk;  there is a small altitude
change. This is approximately a 1/2 Mile round trip.


Coordinates are for the parking lot.
See further below for special handicapped information:
At no point will you be required to, nor should you, leave the
paved trail. Completion of this multi-stage, micro geocache will
require information obtained from inside the Nature Center. This
will require a visit during normal hours of operation (hours listed
below). A Big THANKS to the staff for their assistance in setting
up clues to solve the first stage!
First Stage is a small piece of metal with the final digits of
the N &amp;amp;  W Coordinates for the Second Stage stamped in. Keep in
mind that these have been placed so muggles will, hopefully, walk
by them completely unawares. Think outside of the box.
Go the the parking area at the front entrance of the Nature
Center. After finishing in the Center, hikers can take either the
Tulip Poplar Hill Trail from the North side of the Center (left
side as you are facing the front of the building) OR the Ridgetop
Trail on the South side of the Center (right side, rear as you are
facing the front of the building). There are maps of the trail in
the Center.

To complete the coordinates you must explore the nature centers
exhibits:

 Longitude: N37 20.XXX
Find the timeline of conservation history within the exhibit area.
Subtract the deer population in 1925 from the last three digits of
that year 1(925). Add the LAST two digits of the year the Missouri
Conservation Commission was established. This number will be your
last three digits of the North Coordinate 
CHECK SUM: Add each digit of your answer together. You will get
a two digit number. Add those two digits together. You should get
&apos;9&apos;.
Example - N37 12.345 . . . 3+4+5=12 1+2=3
Lattitude: W089 35.XXX
Find the &quot;Muddy Swamps to Useful Tools&quot;, &quot;Fishing in Times Past&quot;
and &quot;Working with Wood&quot; exhibits. There are numerals next to each
item in the exihibits. (1) Mussel Shells;  (2) Hematite
Plummets; (3) Beaver Teeth Gouges IN THAT ORDER will give
you the last three digits of the West Coordinate.
CHECK SUM:Add each digit of your answer together. You will get a
single digit number. You should get &apos;5&apos;.
Example - N89 11.111 . . . 1+1+1=3
Correct, completed coordinates will take you to the first stage,
which is a micro, no log.

At the first stage, you will find the last three decimals of the
North and West coordinates for the second stage.
N37 20.XXX
W089 35.XXX

 

Bring a pen to sign the log in the second stage. Please replace
everything as it was found.

 <desc>Go Take A Walk!  Part Five by JohnTee
Cache ID: GC11WQ7
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T1.0
DESC: GO TAKE A WALK! and do a series of geocaches along Cape Girardeau&apos;s
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail. This is Part Five of a series of
caches along the trail, numbered as placed, and NOT in any sequence
along the trail. 
The walk is all paved asphalt, with few, gentle inclines and
occasional bridges. Trail open from 6:00 a.m. ? 11:00 p.m.
The recreation trail is a very popular place when the weather is
the least bit nice. You can expect walkers, joggers and bicyclists.
Be aware of muggles as you cache along the trail. 
This is a micro, log and pencil included. It is marginally
handicapped accessible, depending on the disability.
The recreation trail can be accessed from multiple points in
Cape Girardeau - time to explore! Eventually, you will be able to
geocache multiple caches, from one end to the trail to the other.

Be sure you don&apos;t miss other caches in the area.
Accuracy
Twenty sets of coordinates, with an average 10&apos; Estimated Position
Error (EPE), or better, were averaged to give the final set listed
here.
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail
 For joggers, walkers, bicyclists, rollerbladers and skateboarders,
the 4.4-mile asphalt Cape La Croix Recreation Trail connects the
Osage Community Centre on the north and Shawnee Park Sports Complex
on the south, while avoiding the need to cross city streets. It
provides users with a safe recreational experience as it skirts the
banks of the Cape La Croix Creek.
For more information on the trail, visit the 
Cape Girardeau Parks and Recreation web page.
Permission to place geocaches in Cape Girardeau Parks was
obtained from Dan Muser, Parks and Recreation Department.

Cache is in good shape. Added two blank log sheets. Good to go! Three LOLNADs observed me in the parking lot: get out of car, get in trunk for log, walk off. Return to car with wrong size log, get in trunk, get correct log size, walk off. Ended up meeting them starting their walk. They mentioned they had observed me coming and going, were a little concerned and debating about calling the police. Briefly explained geocaching to them and they were satisfied, if not interested. I wasn&apos;t a paper strip terrorist!  [:D]

Post Reviewer Note
2009-11-17 *gln, Greetings,

I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs.

I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache.
[b]
If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.
[/b] 

If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. 


From the guidelines...       http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint      &quot;... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem.  This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b]  normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing.&quot;  

Thanks for your understanding.

When you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an &quot;Owner Maintenance&quot; log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don&apos;t let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!

[red] DISABLING CACHE: [/red]


Greetings,

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last couple logs on this cache, it appears that this cache may be  in need of repair or at least should be checked.   Since there may  still be  a container in the  area, I can not archive it.  When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then.

Hope things get fixed up soon.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

If everything turns out to be fine you can enable this  at any time. 

[b]If I do not hear from you about fixing up this cache, I will assume that it is abandoned  and archive this cache  sometime in the future.

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T3.0
DESC: Located in the Kelso Bird Sanctuary/Springdale Bird Sanctuary area
of Juden Creek Conservation Area. A moderate hike of one mile,
round trip. Multiple elevation changes of up to approximately 75
feet. Easily done in 30-45 minutes.
Highlights 
This area is the Juden Creek Natural History Area operated by
the Missouri Department of Conservation, the City of Cape Girardeau
and Southeast Missouri State University. As you park, approximately
the first 300 yards of your hike is part of Twin Trees Park,
administered by the City of Cape. The roughly north-south trail
then heads off into the eight acre MODC area. For the cache you
will branch off into the SEMSU administered Audobon Kelso Bird
Sanctuary.
Starting on the main trail, there will be a branch off to the
left, which you will take. You can hike well-defined trail to
within about 150&apos; of the geocache.
There is a pond adjacent to the cache area - FISHING IS NOT
ALLOWED. This area is known for its wildflowers.
Facilities/features: hiking trail that links to neighboring Kelso
Bird Sanctuary and Twin Trees County Park, permanent stream (Juden
Creek). If you hike quietly enough you might come up on deer or
turkey. While you&apos;re out here, you should continue on down the main
trail to the 
Juden Creek Geocache.
This is a wildlife santuary - Take nothing but pictures,
leave nothing but footprints
Driving Directions
Juden Creek Conservation Area. Take Highway 177 (Big Bend Road -
from downtown Cape Area) north through Cape Girardeau. At the north
edge of the city limits, turn right on Old Missouri Route V and
continue 125 yards.

Had to come out and visit one of my &apos;Lonely Caches&apos;. There had been a brush fire in the area yesterday and I wanted to see if the cache had been affected. Hiked through the area that had burned on the way to the cache. Cache is removed from the burn area and in good shape. Plenty of room in the log. Put a few new items in the cache. Shot a new set of coordinates with my Vista HCx just for grins.

Come visit. It&apos;s a great walk in the woods. Takes about 15 minutes to walk in.

Benjamin Franklin
The cache is placed on the grounds of the oldest elementary
school in Cape Girardeau. Franklin opened its doors in 1927.
Named for our most well-known founding father, Benjamin Franklin
(17 Jan 1706 - 17 Apr 1790) was a leading author, politician,
printer, scientist, philosopher, publisher, inventor, civic
activist, and diplomat. As a scientist he was a major figure in the
history of physics for his discoveries and theories involving
electricity. As a political writer and activist, he more than
anyone, invented the idea of an American nation. Franklin the
diplomat secured the French alliance that made independence
possible.
&quot;We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang
separately.&quot; 
Words of wisdom certainly applicable 300 years later.....
**The school is still active and permission has been granted to
place this cache. Please exercise common sense. This school is
active so if possible, hunt this cache after school hours or
weekends. Folks tend to get a little skeptical when strangers are
milling around school grounds.
Hint: Lift my cover for easy access.

We headed down to Perryville and the Cape and had a great and cold time.  Lots of really nice caches.  But it was cold.  Thanks for all the great caches.

Cache ID: GC10YPM
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: A simple cache located on a trailhead of the Cape LaCroix Recreation Trail.
This micro is part of the winter 2007 Cape Girardeau cache frenzy. I haven&apos;t seen this many caches released in this area..... EVER! 

The Cape LaCroix Recreation Trail is a 4.42 mile trail cutting through the heart of Cape Girardeau. It is a paved trail and is quite popular when the weather is nice. The area in which the cache is placed could be full of muggles depending upon the time of year so exercise caution when retrieving the cache. The coordinates were averaged with a 10.2 ft estimated position error. 

The trail is generally flat with gentle rises and a few bridges along the way. This should be relatively handicap accessible.
Hint: I have a magnetic personality.

Carbondale
I have replaced the cache container;  it is now a camouflaged ammo
can. I also moved the cache to a hopefully dryer location. It is a
little farther off the trail and by a more remote part of the
trail. . Please hide the cache back as found and enjoy the short
hike and abundant wildlife. Green Earth Wetlands (III) The wetland
has been planted with native grasses and other wetland species. It
can be accessed from the south off of Chatauqua Road. The pull-off
for the Wetlands property is about half-way between Tower Road and
Emerald Lane, on the north side of the street. The trail is usually
muddy--it is a _wet_land after all! You can keep your feet dry and
still get to the north end of the open wetland field by entering
the property from the east in the woodland portion. There is an
access point at the terminus of Freeman Drive (just to the west of
the intersection of Freeman and Emerald Lane). GE Wetlands forms
the southern trailhead for the &apos;supertrail&apos; that runs north to GE
Flaglands.

   This cache is a Geo Card cache.
   Its purpose is to collect as many different geo cards from
   geocachers as possible. Anyone who has there own geocard should
   leave one in the cache. If you don?t have a geocard to leave
   please feel free to look at everyone elses and sign the log. I
   only ask that no one remove any cards in the cache, after all
   the whole purpose is to collect as many as possible.

At one time there was another cache located here, however it was
archived eons ago. I remembered how beautiful the area was and I
decided that another cache should be placed here. I hope you enjoy
your visit. There are 6000 species of trees, shrubs, &amp;amp; 
wildflowers for you to enjoy on the way to the Cache!!

 The cache consist of a medium sized plastic cameo jar. The
original contents of the cache include about a dozen different
geocards from various geocachers, a white jeep TB, a log book and
pen.

D1.0/T2.5
DESC: The cache is located off of a primitive trail that has a moderate rise in a couple of spots.
South Park Trail is a cache located in Cape Girardeau County Park South, on the west side of U.S. 61 across from the county&apos;s North Park and Nature Center, just north of Cape Girardeau, Mo.
 The South Park is adjacent to Memorial Park. It can only be reached from southbound U.S. 61.
 A Cape Girardeau historical marker at the entrance to the park provides a clue to the location of the cache. Names found on both sides of the marker will assist in spelling out the clue by answering the following questions:

First word:
1. What are the first two letters of the last name of the railroad builder?
2. What are the initials of the town founder?
3. What is the second letter of the town founder&apos;s last name?
4. What is the first letter of the name of the female seminary?
Second word:
1. Girardot was a ______. First two letters.
2. The first Indian tribe mentioned. Last two letters.

 After finding the clue, drive to the opposite side of the lake and park in the lot below Shelter 22. Start on the paved trail, but cross the concrete bridge and follow the non-paved hiking trail north.
 The cache is on the left between the trail and the interstate highway.
 NOTE: The South Park may be closed to traffic during winter snow and icy conditions.


** Permission to place the cache was granted by the park superintendent.

 <desc>Land of Lorimier by GeoMeoMy
Cache ID: GCRJHW
Multi-cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T1.0
DESC: The cache is located in downtown Cape Girardeau, MO in the vicinity of the Mississippi River floodwall. The starting point is near Broadway and Water Street.
The Mississippi River has always played a part in the history of Cape Girardeau, Mo. In the 1730&apos;s, a Frenchman named Jean Baptiste Girardot established a trading post near what is now Cape Rock. 
 
Girardot moved on, and in 1793 the Spanish Government gave Frenchman Louis Lorimier a land grant, which included title to this area. He established another trading post near the river.

 On Nov. 23, 1803, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William  Clark brought their Corps of Discovery expedition to Cape Girardeau. Lewis visited with Lorimier, who was Commandant of the territory and community founder.

 Lewis described the physical characteristics of Lorimier in his journal, including his extraordinary mane. Standing about 5&apos;8&apos;&apos; in height, his well-kept tresses were &quot;long enough at one point that they touched the ground when he was standing erect.&quot;

 This geocache is intended to present a pictorial overview of Cape Girardeau&apos;s history through the Mississippi River Tales mural along the river floodwall in downtown Cape Girardeau.
 
The published coordinates are near Broadway and Water Street and provide a starting point for this multi-cache. 

Clues to the cache location will be found in specific mural panels along with general clues below:

 Clue 1: The opposite of &quot;over&quot; is _____.
 Clue 2: The opposite of &quot;front&quot; is _____.
 Clue 3: In the 1803 mural panel, Louis Lorimier is wearing buckskins at a community event. He is holding a _____in his hand. What is the first letter of this object?
 Clue 4: Lorimier is looking at an animal. What are the second and third letters of this animal?
 Clue 5: In the panel description, what are the first and second letters of the name of Lorimier&apos;s wife?
 Clue 6: In the 1909 mural panel, what is the color of the hat worn by the man on the ladder?
 Clue 7: In the panel description, what are the first and second letters of the President&apos;s middle name?
 Clue 8: What are the two large letters on the side of the riverboat?
 Clue 9: In the 1925 panel, what is the middle letter of the bandleader&apos;s nickname?
 Clue 10: The name of the piano player will provide the coordinates to the cache:

This hidden cache is located in a place the Atani call &quot;Jackson

retrieve. Attempting to reach it without the required skill and
gear is strictly forbidden upon pain of grievous injury or death.
The prize for the first to find this cache is the White Jeep Travel
Bug - named Sumerton.


Of Maedhros and Fingon:
At the start of the First Age of Arda, Morgoth stole the hallowed
jewels, the Silmarils, from the house of Fëanor, and fled the
Blessed Lands to Middle Earth. The Noldorian Elves, ignoring wise
council, pursued Morgoth to Middle Earth, making war upon him until
he gave up the Silmarils. However, the Noldor were over-matched,
and found themselves fighting a hopeless war. Early in the conflict
the servants of Morgoth slew Fëanor, King of the Noldor, and
captured his eldest son, Maedhros. Morgoth hung Maedhros by a band
of steel about the wrist of his right hand from the face of a
precipice upon the Thangorodrim, the mountains that rose above his
fortress Angband. For all their strength, the Noldor could not
directly assail Angband - either to recover the Silmarils, or
rescue Maedhros. However, Morgoth feared the newly-appeared Moon
and Sun, and so sent forth mists and fumes from Angband to hide
from them. 

 
Long before the feud that divided their houses - when they dwelt
in the Blessed Lands - Fingon, son of Fingolfin, and Maedhros, son
of Fëanor, were close friends. When news of the torment of Maedhros
reached Fingon he resolved to dare a heroic deed. This deed is to
this day still renowned as among the greatest feats of the Noldor
that brightened the dark time. Fingon the valiant remembered his
old friendship, and without taking counsel he resolved to go alone
to Angband and rescue Maedhros. Using the mists for cover, Fingon
approached Angband and scaled the heights of the Thangorodrim in
stealth. He climbed to just below Maedhros, but for all his bravery
and determination, was not able to climb the last few feet to
complete the rescue. Maedhros bid him to mercifully end his pain.
Just as Fingon drew his bow to put a shaft though Maedhros&apos;s heart,
a great eagle came, Thorondor, took Fingon and bore him up to
Maedhros. However, though he tried with all his strength, Fingon
could not remove the band that held Maedhros upon Thangorodrim. In
the end it was necessary to sever Maedhros&apos;s hand. The heroic
rescue of Maedhros from Thangorodrim by Fingon healed a rift
between the houses of the Noldor, and Maedhros went on to unite the
houses in the Union of Maedhros, an alliance that for a while met
with some success in the war against Morgoth.
This cache commemorates the heroic rescue of Maedhros by Fingon
from the crags of the Thangorodrim.


 
The location of the hidden treasure is contained in a message -
possibly written in Quenya, the language of the Noldorian Elves. If
this is the case, you will need to know (or learn) enough Quenya to
understand this message. To this end, several links to online
resources are provided. However, it is not that simple - the
message is encrypted with a Noldorian cipher. The Eldar valued
simple, graceful elegance coupled with effective function in all
they created. Their ciphers were straightforward and logical with
no unnecessary complication - but were also extremely strong. It is
said that of all the ciphers used by the Eldar, the servants of
Morgoth were never able to crack even one. Fortunately, the key for
this message is available. Although the key is only partially
filled in, enough information is present to decipher the
message.
The cipher used here is called Tarmasundar (&quot;Roots of the
Pillar&quot;), and the cipher key is called ambalotsë (&quot;Uprising
Flower&quot;). The cipher-text for a single character of the menta
(&quot;message&quot;) is a pair of symbols, the first is called the
tengwë-tulwëo, and the second is the tengwë-témo. One particular
column of the ambalotsë is called the tulwë, and one row is called
the téma. The cipher-text is deciphered by finding the
tengwë-tulwëo in the tulwë, and finding the tengwë-témo in the
téma. The row of the tengwë-tulwëo in the tulwë, and the column of
the tengwë-témo in the téma are the row and column respectively of
the plain-text character in the tercen (transcription table). As
each (tengwë-tulwëo, tengwë-témo) pair is deciphered into a
character of plain-text message, the tulwë and téma change. If the
tulwë and téma remained constant, the Tarmasundar would be merely a
mono-alphabetic substitution cipher, which would be easy to defeat
with a frequency or expected-word/pattern attack. The new tulwë is
the column of the tengwë-témo in the previous téma, and the new
téma is the row of the tengwë-tulwëo in the previous tulwë. Thus
from the current (tengwë-tulwëo, tengwë-témo) pair, and the current
(tulwë, téma) and the previous (tulwë, téma), one obtains the next
(tulwë, téma), which is to be used to decipher the next
(tengwë-tulwëo, tengwë-témo) pair. Thus an enciphered message
consists of the cipher-text - a list of (tengwë-tulwëo,
tengwë-témo) pairs - plus the initial (tulwë, téma), and initial
&quot;previous&quot; (tulwë, téma). Traditionally the initial (tulwë, téma)
was written just before the encrypted message, with the initial
&quot;previous&quot; (tulwë, téma) written right after that.
The complete ambalotsë - needed for deciphering the menta - is
derivable from the partial ambalotsë which is shown here. The Eldar
frequently kept Tarmasundaron ambalotsi in partial form as an added
security measure - while completing a ambalotsë was an easy task
for the Eldar, it was exceptionally difficult for even the most
inspired servants of Morgoth. Thus an ambalotsë could be easily
completed when needed, but if intercepted by the enemy would be
difficult and slow to be used. It is clear that for Tarmasundar to
function each of the 16 rows of the ambalotsë must contain each of
the 16 possible values exactly once, and each of the 16 columns
must contain each of the 16 possible values exactly once. The
cipher is strongest when the (tulwë, téma) pairs repeat
infrequently and unpredictably. Thus the Eldar limited the
ambalotsi they used in the following way: The 16x16 grid was
divided into 16 4x4 boxes, and each box contained each of the 16
possible values exactly once.



menta






úaqua ambalotsë






tercen



 
Most likely the plain-text message is written in Quenya - thus
after it is deciphered one may need to translate it into English.
Since there are few left who still speak the ancient tongue of the
Eldar, links to helpful resources concerning their alphabet
(Tengwar) and languages (Quenya, Sindarin, etc) have been included

2006-06-09 nefariousrogue, Ahh yes, the Black widow spiders.  I didn&apos;t list them , as that was the one thing out there that we were fortunate enough NOT to encounter.  I did find one deep pocket close to the cache area that was filled with them, I noticed it when I shined my flashlight up in.  I think they were wolf spiders though.

2006-06-09 kahultman, Congrats to lucasyoung and GarretJax22 for solving the riddle and finding the cache! It&apos;s a beutiful area and I hope you got in a few good climbs.

Since the cache is quite easy to spot after topping out an easy climb, many climbers happened across the cache before I logged the &quot;first to crack the code to find&quot; FTCTCTF? Perhaps they could have hid the cache a little more.

Garret, there was a note to receive the white jeep travel bug. The cache owners asked for my address, but have yet to send it.  That&apos;s why I haven&apos;t logged it in my possession.

Lucas, under one of your photos you list all the mean insects, but you forgot to mention Black Widow spiders, which are commonly found in the pockets of the rock!

I&apos;m probably going to establish another cache at the falls  (without a difficult puzzle), so look for that soon.
Found it
2006-06-02 GarretJax22, This being team nefarious&apos;s first long distance travel to cache, I&apos;d say this was our best trip yet.  Everything in this area is excellent!  No wonder there are plenty of camper/hiker/climbers out here any given day!  This is definitly a place I&apos;d like to come back to someday and just take a full weekend to relax and soak it in.  I&apos;d like to comment, there is no white jeep left in this cache.  I&apos;m assuming the details on how to recieve it were on the FTF note.  And I&apos;m thinking the guy that claimed it as FTF needs to log it if he&apos;s got it!  And my note to people planning on attempting this cache, WATCH OUT FOR THE TICK WASPS!
Found it
2006-06-02 nefariousrogue, I was sort of hopeing to make this cache my 100th find, and I even tried to cache heavily going into the weekend, but alas, I didn&apos;t make it.  I finished the puzzle work for this cache some time in January, but waited this long to make the journey down to the falls.  This is apparently a popular place, and it was the previously logged finder was not the first to find.  Many climbers before found the cache, and possibly many more after us.  We saw at least 4 different sets of climbers on the wall near the cache a couple days after us.  Geocachers, or maybe just climbers.  We found the climbing to be not overly difficult, and it wasn&apos;t wet either.  It wasn&apos;t too pleasing to look down and see a giant wolf spider on my carbiner.  It jumped off before I could reach for my red noldorian fire sword and take down.  We enjoyed the fantastic vue, and the terrain of the road leading out there.  My pictures don&apos;t give away the location details about the cache, so don&apos;t think you can &quot;crack the menta&quot; the easy way.

2006-05-08 ClimbGuy, Long before I knew what geocaching was we found this cache on accident while on a climbing trip to Illinois.  I&apos;ve been into caching since 2007 now and I&apos;m finding this cache on the website realizing we were here. With out know it this cache may have sparked the interest in caching that has finally taken off for me.  I won&apos;t count this as a find because I wasn&apos;t officially a geocacher then but I certainly wanted to note it.  We really enjoyed this area.  Take the time to do this cache!!  Thanks!
Found it
2006-03-19 kahultman, Well this was quite a journey! And a very fun puzzle and climb. Two months and many vertical feet later, I finally found the cache.

I worked on the puzzle for a few hours each day for about a week. If difficulty can be measured in time, then this was harder than the actual climb. After getting the message decrypted, it was off to the land &quot;the Atani call Jackson Falls.&quot; Being from St Louis this is the best closest place to climb, and I was pumped after finding out there was a geocache there. On Saturday I walked around where I thought the cache would be, and the reading on my GPSr pointed us to a very wet location, and a difficult climb. Disappointed, we went on our way to climb other routes. On Sunday, I took a different approach, and I guess this gave me more accurate readings. This time, the climb was within my abilities and was mostly dry. I flashed the route (which basically means I climbed it on lead, without falling, first attempt) and the cache was within reach. 

Took the FTF note, and a blue Noldorian sword (which happened to be useful in slaying the Dragon of Pricker Peak; ). I left a material that all who wish to scale the Crags of Thangorodrim in summer will find helpful, a sample supply of Tite-Grip hand drying lotion; )  

Thank you so much for placing the cache and making it such a fun challenge. And for not listening to those who thought it wouldn&apos;t be done, be a waste of time etc.

DESC: Future History Chapter 1: The lost treasure of Jean Lafitte
I was traveling through the swampy bayous from Cairo to Cape
Girardeau on Route 3 recently when I noticed on my map, the tiny
village of Cache, Illinois. I was intrigued by the name, for
reasons obvious to any geocacher. But curious, too, how this tiny
settlement, now a ghost town, came by its enigmatic name. I decided
to do a little research, the results of which are transmitted in
the following report. It?s an interesting story. I can?t verify the
facts, as they are nowhere to be found in the written record ?
until now. 
Jean Lafitte (ca 1780 ? ca 1826) was a legendary pirate in the
Gulf of Mexico in the early 19th century. Lafitte, a colorful
character, was reportedly born in either France or Hispaniola in
what is current day Haiti. Though well known in history and
folklore, both the pirate&apos;s origins and his demise are unknown.
Lafitte was well known throughout the lower (below St. Louis)
Mississippi River valley. Despised by the authorities, he was a
generous and heroic figure to many of the area?s settlers. He
regularly attacked British, French and Spanish merchant ships
(Lafitte claimed never to have plundered an American vessel) in the
Gulf of Mexico. Afterwards, he usually hightailed it to his secret
&quot;kingdom&quot; of Barataria in the swamps and bayous near New Orleans.
From there, he often transferred his ill-gotten booty to
flat-bottomed riverboats and navigated upstream to Kaskaskia
Island.
On the way he made many stops to camp and visit the trappers,
hunters and farmers that lived at the river?s edge. He traded food
and shelter for rifles, gunpowder, axes, cooking pots and many
other essential items that he plundered from the merchant ships.
Needless to say, Lafitte was considered a friend and hero to most
everyone on the river.
Lafitte buried much of his treasure on Kaskaskia Island (N37°
55.282&apos;, W89° 54.989&apos;), or stashed it in caves in the adjacent
river bluffs. That was his plan in early 1812, as he stopped to
camp at the mouth of what is now called the Cache River (N37°
5.254&apos;, W89° 15.751&apos;). There he planned to rest for a couple of
days and visit an old friend, Willard Roth, who trapped beaver and
muskrats in the nearby swamps. Lafitte picked this spot for good
reasons: from this point he had a clear view of river for five
miles downstream. Also, the next 18 miles upstream offered many
hiding spots among the numerous islands, bayous and horseshoe
bends.




 
Lafitte didn?t know that General Jacques Villieres, leading a
battalion of the New Orleans Militia, was hot on his trail and only
two days behind. As he prepared to continue his trip to Kaskaskia,
on the morning of 07 February 1812, Villieres and his flat-bottomed
flotilla appeared off Boston Bar, some four miles downstream.
Lafitte did not panic. He had over an hour to break camp, though he
knew Villieres would spot him if they put their boats on the river.
If this happened Lafitte also knew that he would have to fight,
because he would never escape Villieres. Being heavily outnumbered,
Lafitte quickly devised a clever, but daring escape plan. To avoid
detection, he hid his men, boats and treasure in the dense cypress
swamps about 2/3 of a mile up the Cache River. He left his camp in
place, with the fires burning and breakfast cooking in the pots.
When Villieres spotted this, he felt certain that Lafitte was just
around the next bend, maybe less than a mile ahead of him. The
militia quickly resumed their upstream pursuit with renewed
vigor.
Villieres knew Lafitte well, however, and took the precaution of
leaving a dozen men at the campsite, in case Lafitte was playing
just such a trick. The question now for Lafitte: should he fight
the small squadron of militia, or try to sneak past them in the
dark of night? The moon was waning (new moon being on the 12th).
The day was overcast with a cold rain. If this continued the
chances were good that he could sneak out that night and race
downstream, back to New Orleans, undetected. Lafitte decided to
wait.
What Lafitte hadn?t foreseen was the New Madrid Earthquake, the
largest earthquake ever recorded in the continental United States.
Early that afternoon, while Lafitte and his crew sat quietly in
their boats, waiting for nightfall, all hell broke loose. The
Mississippi boiled furiously and ran backwards for the next two
days. Their heavily laden boats nearly capsized as water rushed up
the Cache River, pushing Lafitte and his crew half a mile inland,
to the current cache location. Having run aground on this ridge of
slightly higher land, Lafitte decided to ditch his king?s ransom in
gold, silver and jewels. Then he and his men pushed off again and
scrambled for the river bluffs, half a mile to the northeast.
Lafitte eventually resurfaced in New Orleans. He fought for the
USA in the War of 1812. After being run out of New Orleans around
1817 Lafitte relocated to the island of Galveston, Texas
establishing a private &quot;kingdom&quot; he called &quot;Campeche.&quot; In Galveston
Lafitte either purchased or set his claim to a lavishly furnished
mansion used by French pirate Louis-Michel Aury, which he named
Maison Rouge. The building&apos;s upper level was converted into a
fortress where cannon commanding Galveston harbor were placed.
Around 1820 Lafitte reportedly married Madeline Regaud, possibly
the widow or daughter of a French colonist who had died during an
ill-fated expedition to Galveston. In 1821 the brig-of-war USS
Enterprise was sent to Galveston to remove Lafitte&apos;s presence from
the Gulf after one of the pirate&apos;s captains attacked an American
merchant ship. Lafitte agreed to leave the island without a fight
and in 1821 or 1822 departed on his flagship the Pride, burning his
fortress and settlements and reportedly taking immense amounts of
treasure with him. Currently the remains of Maison Rouge sit under
the ruins of a later 19th century structure near downtown
Galveston.
After his departure from Galveston, Lafitte was never heard from
again. Rumors have long circulated that Lafitte died in a hurricane
in the Gulf or in the Yucatan around 1826. A controversial
manuscript, known as the &apos;Journal&apos; of Jean Lafitte, relates how,
after his announced death in the 1820s, he lived in several states
in the United States, and raised a family until his death in St.
Louis in the 1840&apos;s. Reportedly at his request, the publication of
the journal was delayed for 107 years and surfaced in the 1950&apos;s in
the hands of a man claiming to be the pirate&apos;s descendant.
Lafitte never returned to claim his treasure. His journal
contains a brief description of that historic day?s events. It
includes a crudely sketched map of the area, with a spot, marked
with an ?X? and labeled simply as ?Cache.? He describes building a
small stone cairn located 100 paces north of the burial site. The
cairn is now gone, of course, but the buried treasure? No one knows
for sure, but this is how Cache got its name. When you hunt this
cache, keep in mind that you are standing within 100 paces of
Lafitte?s richest treasure, which may still be buried here.

You&apos;re looking for a decon container. It has only a log (no more

enjoy the view - that is, if the wind isn&apos;t too rough! When you

This travel bug-rich cache is an easy find on an easy walk. It&apos;s
just a few feet off an established trail in a beautiful park in
southern Illinois, minutes from restaurants and the area&apos;s only

There are two barracks, three block houses, officer quarters, well,
stockade, and a fence. There&apos;s an extremely nice visitors center
nearby where you can find a roaring fire by which to sit on nippy
days. There are living history groups periodically and an annual
reenactment, the Massac Encampment, to bring history to life in the
fort. There&apos;s also picnicking, boating, and camping within the
park, as well as hunting in season. This property is managed by the
Illinois Department of Natural Resources - they do a great job, as
this is the cleanest park I think I&apos;ve ever been in! For more
information about the park itself, just go to the visitors center
and ask!
There are two places to park. The best is N37 08.703 W088
42.717;  look across the parking lot and follow the trail that
shares its name with a Frenchman. This is the best and prettiest
way to get to the cache. If you&apos;re pressed for time or have
difficulty walking, you can park at N 37 08.723 W 088 42.539 and
take the trail connector away from the main road. Please restrict
your cache-hunting to daylight hours, as everyone feels very safe
in this park and people poking around in the dark in the woods
might shake folks up. The cache is just feet from an established
trail. Please stay on the trail until you come to the cache. It is
hidden by the surroundings. One of the agreements to hiding a cache
in this park is to not disturb the natural surroundings, so please
don&apos;t get busy trying to camouflage it with sticks, rocks, leaves,
etc. Just put it back the way you found it and it should be
okay.
It&apos;s a 30 cal ammo can with a green geocaching sticker on the
side. Original contents are: log book, pencil, stash note;  2005

2009-12-19 Cachewrights, Stay in town last night on our way to Wi from Fl. It was a cold morning my wife and 2 year old and I wanted to grab a quick cache before we headed out of town. Our little guy only made it about 5 mins before he was begging to go back to the car. So my wife took him back while I contiunued. We would of had it in hand b then if I had actually loaded the correct cords, but after i figured out what I did wrong, I found it fairly quickly. There was no coin as listed but the cache was great, thanks for the find. I enjoyed this area.

Cache ID: GCT024
Unknown Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T1.5
DESC: This is an American Flag themed cache. Please trade only items that
are Red, White, and Blue. If you do not have anything to trade that
meets the theme, don&apos;t despair, as long as you promise to wear it
proudly you are welcome to take a flag pin or bracelet.
There is nothing at the above coordinates. 

First you will need to do a little research to find out how many
stars the American Flag had after Kentucky joined the union? Number
of stars = X

You will need to add 5 times X to N37 05.3??

You will need to add X to W088 37.8??

These Coordinates will bring you to a Roadside Marker at Paducah&apos;s
Betsy Ross Park. 
 
 To get to the next stage you will need to gather information from
the Roadside Marker z9information above) to determine Distance and
Bearing to Project a waypoint:

To determine the Distance 0.A B mile, You will need:

A = The only Roman Numeral on the Marker.
B = The third number in the date the Official Flag was
presented.

To determine Bearing C D E degrees, You will need:

C = The last number in the Deed of Dedication Date.
D = The last number of the Birth date.
E = The third number in the Birth date.

This projected waypoint will take you to a Flag.
For those who own a GPS that will only project to 1 decimal point
just round up and keep a look out for the flag as you get close to
your projected waypoint. 
From the Flag the Cache is 50 feet West North West (Bearing 309
degrees, Distance 0.01).


&amp;nbsp; 
Hint: [To Test Your Answers: add the numbers in the answer together]
[# of stars] - The sum is six
[Distance] - Less than a half mile, sum is ten
[Bearing] - Sum is twelve

2009-03-25 GEO.JOE, As mentioned in the log, I made when I disabled this cache, the park is closed due to dangerous situations caused by the ice storm. Limbs are down all over the place, many trees are down and there are a lot of broken limbs still hanging in the trees. There are contractors working in the park to get it cleaned as quick as possible but it is a huge undertaking that will take quite some time to complete. When the park/trail reopens I will enable this cache and the other caches I have in the park and on the Greenway Trail, but they will remain disabled until the parks department gives the OK. I am aware of the enabled/disabled status of every one of my caches. I am checking on the conditions of the areas of all may caches as quickly as I can and I will do what needs to be done for each one of them based on the safety/accessibility/availability of the areas where the caches are placed.

2009-12-21 CyclonicKWF, The month and year are winding down and in need of a cache for December I took sometime from my Holiday break to grab some caches. Since we had been visiting my wife&apos;s family in Calvert City I figured this would be a great time to hit some of the caches in Northern Land Between the Lakes.

This was my first cache after crossing into Land Between the Lakes.  This when took me a little time just because of the hiking involved.  Definitely staying on the trail helps especially the Blue One.  I went down connector A which was a wrong move.  Nice idea for the first stage.  After finding it I proceeded to the final stage.  I found the final stage after hiking to the location.  After signing the log I replaced the container without swapping any swag.  I then retraced my steps back down the trail to my vehicle.

Thanks for the cache.

I think I would park at the top of the hill next time, as we ended up way on the other side after completing the cache but took the road back to the parking coordinates.  Kukibob managed to grab the cache first as we raced through the woods;  I grabbed the skull instead of the cache (wish I had taken a picture of it now!).  TFTCSL

DESC: This is our first hide so we tried to make it fairly easy. The terrain is not very difficult and consists of a gravel road and baked clay and sometimes dirt or mud depending on the weather. It is generally flat with few long weeds/grass and just some brush and trees. The cache itself is not in plain view.
The cache is an ammo can. Original contents include a log book, small pencil and pen, Geocache info, superballs, sports balls, matchbox cars, jumprope, whistles, a yoyo, and a small flag.

Recommended parking is a paved road (N 37 05.689 , W 088 40.234) but one could drive down a gravel/dirt road to get closer.  This road can become very muddy and floods over just enough to get a car stuck (trust me).

DESC: This is our first attempt at hiding a cache, hope everyone enjoys it.  Cache is a green waterproof matchcase. Contains logbook and stashnote. Bring your own pencil.
This cache located on the Hickman Bluff, site of the Bluff Project, which started in 1996 and was completed in 2000.  After years of erosion the bluff threatened the Public Libary, the Great River Road Carnegie Museum, the towns water supply, and also closed Magnolia Street.  To help reinforce the bluff, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers came in and installed 45&apos; reinforcing nails, covered in hillside with shotcrete, and reconstructed part of the hillside.

The view from this location is wonderful all times of the year.  From here you can see across the Mississippi River into Missouri, into the county&apos;s well known, Upper Bottom.  (Farming and hunting area)

 <desc>For My Sweetheart by GEO.JOE
Cache ID: GCMZ63
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T3.0
DESC: This cache is located in a wonderful Shawnee National Forest valley
with a waterfall, swimming hole, giant boulders and everything is
covered in moss!
I am placing this cache for my sweetheart because just southwest of
the cache is a large boulder that looks like a heart laying on it&apos;s
side. I have a little tradition that while I am out hiking or
kayaking I am always on the lookout for heart shapes in natural
formations such as trees, reflections at a riverbank, natural wind
or water eroded areas, leaves, lichen.. etc. I take pictures of the
hearts as gifts to Fairy Flirt. She also has a small collection of
heart shaped rocks that I have been lucky enough to find from all
around the country. 

Hopefully this valley will hold something special for everyone. At
the head of the valley is a beautiful waterfall that terminates in
a soothing blue pool. Based on the dove blue color of the pool I
will venture to say it is likely a spring and will make a nice
place to cool off in the summer. The waterfall cascades over a
shelf and you can walk behind the falling water. The source of the
falls is a slick rock creek with it&apos;s own little pools and mini
waterfalls to explore. Just above the falls is a large, flat moss
covered area that will provide the perfect place to have a romantic
picnic or to just sit and admire the views of the valley. Each side
of the valley has it?s own unique attractions. The trail on the
north side will take you up close to gigantic boulders, rock
formations, rock falls with tunnels between and under boulders,
rocks to climb around on, multiple levels of the bluff to explore
and of course the cache. The south side provides more open and
grand views of the valley, a better view of the largest boulder I
have ever seen and it leads around the ridge to the valley with the
Arch. I was also told by a hunter that many years back, in this
general area, he found a bunch of Native American rock art near a
waterfall, this could be the area, so keep an eye out. 

For those that may be interested in spending the night out in the
wilderness there is a primitive camp site(Flat place in the woods ?
NO FACILITIES other than that tree or maybe that rock) along the
River to River Trail (blue i) at N37 30.414 W88 46.840. It is only
a .71 mile hike in from the parking spot, so it is not too far to
pack in everything that you need. It would be a nice place for a
base camp for a couple of days of exploring. It is also next to
Cedar Creek with suitable places to take a swim. 
 
Parking for this cache is located at N37 30.494 W88 47.476 where
the River to River Trail comes out onto a gravel road. You will be
hiking on shared Hiking/Equestrian trails and with the number of
seep springs there will likely be muddy areas so wear appropriate
footwear. 1 to 3 creek crossings are likely, they are typically
easy to cross on rocks without getting your feet wet but after a
rain or snowmelt they can be higher. From the campsite there is a
1.50 mile loop that will take you along each side of the valley
with the Arch cache and each side of the valley with For My
Sweetheart cache. The trail head to For My Sweetheart is on the
north side of the creek marked with Yellow spray paint on two
trees. The trail to the Arch is on the south side of the creek
behind the primitive camp. There is a trail junction .19 mile south
of the arch (N37 30.115 W88 46.974) that is also marked by yellow
paint that will continue the loop to For My Sweetheart. If you like
waterfalls there is another one to check out .12 mile south of the
trail junction near N37 30.058 W88 46.863 (also check out the
secret passage behind the bluff at these coordinates). Two more
waterfalls that are a little more than a trickle, except after a
rain, are located at N37 30.039 W88 46.986. The distance to get
three caches (Cedar Creek, Arch and For My Sweetheart) and complete
the loop, not counting side excursions and explorations, will be 3
miles. I average about 4.75 miles when I explore this area. So when
you visit plan to spend some time here. Bring a lunch and take the
time to explore and enjoy the area.

But it&apos;s a beautiful day and no signs of any storms rushing in. You have to learn to slow down some as ya miss a lot of things. I did and had a great time.

We started out at about 3:30pm and did not get out until 8:00pm, It got dark on us cause we were having fun exploring the area and lots of trees were down from the ice several weeks ago. We actually got turned around a little bit in the dark, We did not have much light small flashlight and a Triton 2000. I will be back here this summer to do some camping.

 <sym>Traditional Cache</sym>
 <desc>Arch by GEO.JOE
Cache ID: GCM3ZG
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T3.0
DESC: All I can say is, &quot;This Arch is Awesome.&quot;
I have visited arches and natural bridges throughout Kentucky
(Natural Bridge SP, Red River Gorge), Southern Illinois (Pomona,
Garden of the Gods ), and Utah (Arches NP, Canyon Lands NP, Natural
Bridge NM) and this is one of my favorite aches. It is unlike any
other arch I have seen. I do not want to give away too much of the
surprise so I will not give more of a description. When I came
around a boulder to see this arch for the first time I exclaimed
&quot;This Arch is Awesome.&quot; Therefore I would like to allow all of the
visitors to have their own first experience as they come around
that boulder. 

To reach this cache will require a 2 to 6 mile hike on shared
Hiking/Equestrian trails and with the number of seep springs there
will likely be muddy areas so ware appropriate boots. 1 to 6 creek
crossings are likely, they are typically easy to cross on rocks
without getting your feet wet but after a rain or snowmelt they can
be higher. This cache can be reached from the parking area for
Buffalo Rock cache: N37 29.799 W88 45.536 or Cedar Creek cache
parking area: N37 30.494 W88 47.476. 

For those that may be interested in spending the night out in the
wilderness there is a primitive camp site(Flat place in the woods ?
NO FACILITIES other than that tree or maybe that rock) along the
River to River Trail (blue i) at N37 30.414 W88 46.840. It is only
a .71 mile hike in from a parking spot, so it is not too far to
pack in everything that you need. It would be a nice place for a
base camp for a couple of days of exploring. It is also next to
Cedar Creek with suitable places to take a swim. 
 
While in the area plan to visit the valley with For My Sweetheart
cache to see a beautiful waterfall and gigantic boulders. I was
also told by a hunter that many years back he found a bluff with
Native American rock art near a waterfall, this could be the area,
so keep an eye out for red to yellow markings. From the campsite
there is a 1.50 mile loop that will take you along each side of the
valley with the Arch cache and each side of the valley with For My
Sweetheart cache. The trail to the Arch is on the south side of the
creek behind the primitive camp. There is a trail junction .19 mile
south of the arch (N37 30.115 W88 46.974) that is marked by yellow
paint on trees that will continue the loop to For My Sweetheart. If
you like waterfalls there is another one to check out .12 mile
south of the trail junction near N37 30.058 W88 46.863 (also check
out the secret passage behind the bluff at these coordinates). Two
more waterfalls that are a little more than a trickle, except after
a rain, are located at N37 30.039 W88 46.986. The trail head to For
My Sweetheart cache, from the camp site, is on the north side of
the creek and is marked with Yellow spray paint on two trees. 

The distance from parking area N37 30.494 W88 47.476 to get three
caches (Cedar Creek, Arch and For My Sweetheart), and complete the
loop, not counting side excursions and explorations, will be 3
miles. To include Buffalo Rock cache, starting at either parking
coordinate and getting all four caches along Cedar Creek will be a
minimum of 6 miles. So when you visit plan to spend some time here.
Bring a lunch and take the time to explore and enjoy the area.

2009-07-08 KroBro, So not knowing the trails out here, I saw I was getting further away from this hide after leaving &quot;sweetheart&quot; cache. So I doubled back down to the dry bed. Made the crossing and hiked up a ravine. Reached the top , caught my breath and found out I was on the wrong side of the ravine.

So down and up I went again. I neared gz and found a nice spot to rest. Drank the rest of the water I brought. and went for the hide. Easy find and signed in. This really is a great place to hike and explore. I had a good workout today which was very enjoyable. Thanks again GJ for the hike. Made my way out enjoying the whole time.

Cache ID: GCM53J
Multi-cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.5/T1.5
DESC: This cache begins near the Charleston, MO area at an informative new park.  The second age of the cache is about 8 miles away located within 5 feet of a road. Retrieving the cache is the only part that might require any physical effort.  The cache container is a red Bison Tube with a log only.  REMEMBER TO BRING A PEN OR PENCIL!
The first waypoint of the cache will bring you to an interesting outdoor visitor center commemorating Lewis and Clark&apos;s first steps into the Louisiana Purchase. (See the link for the cache page for more details.) 

A few questions need to be answered in order to get to the cache:

a = How many columns are there?

b = How many Native Americans are depicted in the Murals?

c = How many flag poles are there?


The final cache location is near the hometown of someone very special to me.  The locaction of the cache is a place that she used to enjoy looking for turtles and watching out over the fields.

Final Cache Location:

N36 49.1[b+3][c+4]
W89 19.[a]1[a]


Extra fun waypoint:
N36 49.514
W89 19.654
Stop here to ring the bell in memory of Nana!
Hint: The cache is located in the underside of the SW corner of the bridge within a crack.  The cache has a magnetic personality.

2009-10-16 RicknJoy, We headed out this weekend on a 700-mile trip to the Bootheel to finish up the Missouri County Challenge and the Missouri DeLorme Challenge.
Too bad that many of the signs leading to the monument were unreadable. We got the info at WP1, then stopped at Boomtown to get something to drink. THAT was a mistake! 
We found our way to the final and started hunting. The first thing we found was a Smokey Bear tag left by the previous finder - we’ll drop it in another cache. We looked a bit more, and finally found the cache.

DESC: A wooden container in an old forgotten cemetery.
This is in an old cemetery that has graves from 1861 to 1910 or so.  There don&apos;t appear to be any Civil War Veterans buried here, just members of the Boldry family and various other families.  The trees are kind of thick here so the coordinates may not be that accurate.  Use the hint if you need to.  There is an old driveway culvert here but, be careful if you have to back out because it is in a curve.  If it looks muddy, you can also park in a cinder pulloff on the north side of the road a little west of here.  Happy caching from bratzgirl and me!
  I would like to thank all the cachers who have visited this site.  Not only has no one left any trash or mess here, it seems like the visitors here have cleaned up the sticks and leaves, someone even brought a bench.  You can even tell there are headstones just driving by.  I had to replace the log because it was wet.
Hint: Look between Miss Mattie and Miss Georgia

Owned by the Nature Conservancy, the centerpiece of the preserve is Mantle Rock, a 30-foot high natural sandstone bridge, spanning 188 feet. During the harsh winter of 1838-39, many Cherokee Native Americans being expelled along the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; were delayed by treacherous river conditions on the Ohio. They sought shelter under Mantle Rock and other nearby rock shelters. (excerpts from the Mantle Rock Preserve website)

2009-11-04 terrillh60, Wow did this one get hard to do!  I was able to grab it easy, but putting it back was another story!  I sat on the bench to sign the log to keep the hide a secret from the muggles in the area.  When I had finished my entry and I was ready to put it back in its spot there was this guy at the repair shop who was out smoking and watching my every move!  So I pulled out my cell phone and pretended to be talking on it.  I walked back and forth with cell to ear waiting for him to quit looking at me.  After 10 min of pretend cell, I decided I would have to take the cache with me and come back later.  I hit another cache down the road and grabbed a bite to eat before going back to the cache.  Guess what? Yep he was still there on the corner smoking when I drove by 15-20min later!  So I had to park 3 blocks down the street as my car is very unique and he did get a good look at it when I left the first time.  I walked over 1 block and down to the far corner and watched him stand there on the corner with yet another smoke!  I was waiting for someone to call the cops on me, as coming back another day was not an option for me.  After a 5min wait, it Happen!  He went inside!  Yes, yes, yes I left my hiding spot from around the corner and made the drop!  Making it ok for me to head home at last to Clarksville, TN! TFTC!

SIZE: Micro
D2.5/T1.0
DESC: A great spot with a bit of Civil War history and a nice view of the
Ohio River.
This is a mini micro, there is only room to sign the first initial
of your name so remember to bring your own pen. 

This cache will take you to Paducah&apos;s historic riverfront with a
nice view of the Ohio River and of Paducah&apos;s skyline. It is located
at a peice of history so be sure to read the marker near it. The
cache is also near the beautiful, mural painted floodwall so take
some time to enjoy the art work.

 <desc>Civil War Battle For Island #10 by West Tn Dawg
Cache ID: GCN903
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T1.5
DESC: Easy Micro located at a not so famous Civil War Battle site.
With the surrender of  Forts Henry and Donelson, Tennessee, and the evacuation of Columbus, Kentucky, Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, commander of the Confederate Army of the Mississippi, chose Island No. 10, about 60 river miles below Columbus, to be the strongpoint for defending the Mississippi River. Nearby was New Madrid, one of the weak points. 
Brig. Gen. John Pope, commander of the Union Army of the Mississippi, set out from Commerce, Missouri, to attack New Madrid, on February 28. The force marched overland through swamps, lugging supplies and artillery, reached the New Madrid outskirts on March 3, and laid siege to the city. Brig. Gen. John P. McCown, the garrison commander, defended both New Madrid and Island No. 10 from the fortifications. He launched a sortie, under Brig. Gen. M. Jeff Thompson, Missouri State Guard, against the besiegers and brought up heavy artillery to bombard them. 
On the 13th, the Confederates bombarded the Yankees to no avail. Since it did not appear possible to defend New Madrid, the Confederate gunboats and troops evacuated to Island No. 10 and Tiptonville. On the 14th, Pope?s army discovered that New Madrid was deserted and moved in to occupy it. A U.S. Navy flotilla, under the command of Flag-Officer Andrew H. Foote, arrived March 15 upstream from Island No. 10. The ironclad Carondelet on the night of April 4 passed the Island No. 10 batteries and anchored off New Madrid. Pittsburgh followed on the night of April 6. The ironclads helped to overawe the Confederate batteries and guns, enabling Pope?s men to cross the river and block the Confederate escape route. 
Brig. Gen. William W. Mackall, who replaced McCown, surrendered Island No. 10 on April 8. The Mississippi was now open down to Fort Pillow, Tennessee.

Greetings,

I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled, or has not been found for a period of time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can&apos;t do so forever. When you get a chance, please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it (using the [i]archive listing [/i] link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b] log a note to the cache [/b] (not email) so I don&apos;t archive the listing for non-communication. I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. [b]If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.[/b]

If the [B][RED]Needs Maintenance[/B][/RED] attribute is showing you will need to also write a [B][GREEN]Owners Maintenance[/B][/GREEN] note to remove it. http://support.groundspeak.com/Support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=333&amp;nav=0,5,15

DESC: Kiwanis Park (Rotary Drive off of Perryville Road and Lexington
Avenue) is open from 6.00am to 11.00pm. It contains 55.8 acres and
was acquired by the City in 1972. The park contains picnic
shelters, one pick-up baseball field, one small pond, play
structures, and one restroom facility. The park currently has a
considerable amount of open area that will help with future demands
as the surrounding community grows.
Multi-stage with a Micro First Stage and a Regular Second Stage.
Complete both stages to log cache. 
First Stage - You are looking for a well camouflaged micro, that
will contain the coordinates for the second stage. Please replace
it as found. Multiple coordinates averaged with an EPA of about
20&apos;.
Second Stage - You are looking for a &apos;small&apos; geocache with
multiple small items in it. It is well camouflaged. Please replace
it in an upright manner to help keep the contents dry.
The Second Stage is in view of a picnic shelter and play
area. Please be VERY discreet in retrieving the second
stage.
Multiple coordinates averaged with an EPA of about 16&apos;.

Lot&apos;s of muggles nearby today, but I think I managed to get the cache replaced, more or less undetected. The ammo box has been replaced with something a little smaller, and hopefully, less desirable to young muggles. [:D] Maybe a little cooling off period without a cache in place has helped too.

A [url=http://teamgeorangers.blogspot.com/2007/02/got-tott.html]TOTT[/url] may be helpful in locating the cache . . .  [}:)] Heck, might help in finding the first stage too.

2009-08-20 JohnTee, As mentioned in my previous log, and apparently unclear in my &apos;temporarily disable&apos; log of July 28, the [i][b]Second Stage has been removed[/b][/i]. After letting the site &apos;cool&apos; off for a while, I have another cache ready to put back in place. Will not put an ammo box back in, as that seemed to be the item that interested the muggles. Should have the second stage REPLACED in the near future.

Cache ID: GCXPQZ
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T2.5
DESC: An easily accessed, but hidden, collection of natural rock
formations near Breeden Trestle, just off the Tunnel Hill
Rail-to-Trail.
What a collection of hidden treasures this location is. Within just
500 feet from the Tunnel Hill Trail and just 200 feet of the cache
you will see many great rock formations, vistas, and maybe even a
water fall. Just south of the cache is a small sandstone
arch/window with a spring and lush moss just past the arch.
Following the ledge south you will see a balanced rock, a large
split boulder that you can walk between the two halves and then
emerge onto terraced sandstone with a nice view. Above the arch and
split boulder is a really nice sandstone glade. South east along
the bluff from the terraced sandstone you may see seasonal water
falls. If you hear water falling you can make your way through the
scrub oak to the water falls or you can work your way down the
sandstone terraces west to get in the valley where you will find a
lush area with two more springs. From the valley you can work your
way to beneath Breeden Trestle or follow the horse trail back to
the bike trail.

To reach the cache from Tunnel Hill Trail, follow the horse trail
at N37 30.550 W88 51.825.

There are many access points to the Tunnel Hill Trail depending on
your ability and distance you want to ride/hike. The Park offers
parking lots with restrooms, water and picnic tables at Tunnel Hill
(N37 31.423 W88 50.317) and Vienna (N37 24.993 W88 53.183. Breeden
Trestle is 2.5 miles down hill from Tunnel Hill (5 miles round
trip) and 7.5 miles from Vienna mostly flat for the first 5 miles
then slight uphill grade to the Trestle (15 mile round trip). I
also use two other access points and just park along the road by
the Bike trail. The first is at Bloomfield (N37 27.211 W88 52.434)
and this is 4.25 miles to the trestle mostly uphill but a nice down
hill ride back to the car (8.5 mile round trip). The closest access
point is at Sandburn (N37 30.553 W88 50.534) at just 1.5 miles down
hill to the trestle (3 mile round trip). From Sandburn you can
easily ride the .5 mile north to see the tunnel near my Tunnel Hill
cache, then ride the steepest grade of the trail down to Breeden
Trestle and then just ride back the 1.5 to your car when finished.
If you can arrange two cars or a shuttle the prettiest and easiest
ride on the Tunnel Hill Trail is from Tunnel Hill to Vienna.

2009-07-10 murdog41, I am logging my attempt on 7/14 because I was out camping.  Well I biked all the way out there and now I know why I couldn&apos;t find it.  I had a feeling it was gone based on the beer, soda and other stuff I found.  That was one hike of a bike ride.  Unfortunately I will not be back in the area.  TFTAttempt

2009-04-11 dacjohns, Took two young boys on their first geocaching adventure and an adventure it was.  Got wet crossing Hayes Creek and had a lot of fun.

Parked at N37 30.244 W88 35.686 and hiked the River to River Trail (001) to Trail 496B.  We then followed 496B to 493 and followed 493 back to the River to River Trail.  Found the cache then we tried to do some bushwhacking but couldn&apos;t cross Hayes Creek southeast of Petticoat Junction by Trail 496.  Followed the River to River Trail back to where we parked.

Some of the trails were blocked in many places with fallen trees and wwere quite muddy in spots.  The River to River Trail wasn&apos;t too bad.

Beautiful hike along the creek and bluffs.  Spring wildflowers were blooming.

The cache was wet despite being triple wrapped in Zip Lock bags.  Cache consists of a log book and a pencil.

Brookside Park is a nice little park near my home. It is home to The Memorial to Veterans of All Wars. This is a tribute to all who have served our country, from this area, by putting on a uniform in war or peacetime, at home or abroad.

This Memorial is located on top of a 3-acre knoll. An easy paved walk goes up to an open chapel with 11 sentinel columns facing a 120 foot black granite wall displaying over 2400 names of veterans of all 10 of the United States&apos; official wars; 
 The Revolutionary War,
 The War of 1812,
 The Mexican War,
 The Civil War,
 The Spanish-American War,
 WWI,
 WWII,
 The Korean War,
 The Vietnam War, and
 Desert Storm.

Also named are active duty service members.

Nearby is a 35 foot dial featuring 3 huge granite stones engraved in color encompassing our American Flag, the Prisoner&apos;s of War Flag, and the Missouri Flag.

Once at the wall you will have to find some info from the wall.

WP1 to WP2: 37 A.BC  89 D.EF
    Find Guy E. Richter and count from top of his panel. What number is his name on this panel? This is A.
    Find Vern Owens. His middle initial is where in the alphabet? This is B.
    Find Michael W. Glueck. What number from the bottom is he? This is C.
    Go to Vietnam War panel number 2. How many names on this panel? Subtract 7. This is D.
    Find Loy R. Moore. What number is he in the M&apos;s for his war? This is E.
    How long was the Mexican War? This is F.

This will take you to another part of the park where you will find something with white and red reflectors on it.
How many red reflectors are on this? Use this number to lead you to the actual cache.

WP2 to WP3-37 23.A  89 39.B
  A=(90 x number of red reflectors) +1
  B=(107 x number of red reflectors) +4

Hope you enjoy this park and the walk.
 
This is not a film canister but is small. Bring a pen.

Common Pleas Courthouse in downtown Cape Girardeau, Mo. was important to the Union forces which held the city during the Civil War, although the city was sympathetic to the Confederacy. 
 
This multi-cache begins with the coordinates in front of the courthouse looking out to the Mississippi River. Downtown by the floodwall, imagine General Grant working late at night inside his headquarters at the present Port Cape Girardeau building, after the four-hour Battle of Cape Girardeau earlier that day of April 26, 1863.

The courthouse can be reached from Lorimier Street on the west side of the park, or from Spanish Street from the east side, below the terrace steps.

The coordinates to the geocache can be found by using clues from locations inside and nearby the park:

N37° 18.ABC
W089° 31.DEF

A=
On the north side of the courthouse is the gazebo. It was dedicated in honor of Dr. C. E. Schuchert, bandmaster of Schuchert&apos;s Concert Band. On the left historical marker, add the first and last numbers of the year Dr. Schuchert died.

B=
Walk across the street to see the two tile murals on the Southeast Missourian building. In &quot;The Art of Printing,&quot; add the number of letters in the last name of the man &quot;rearing back in his chair.&quot;

C=
In the mural &quot;Gathering and Disseminating News,&quot; add the number of letters in the last name of the Judge of Jackson County, and then subtract 6.

D=
Back at Courthouse Park, walking past the Vietnam and Confederate war memorials, go to the Civil War memorial fountain. A plaque at the base notes the year it was erected. Add the last two numbers of the year.

E=
On the historical marker near the fountain, note the year the courthouse was built. Add the first and last numbers, then subtract 5.

F=
Walk one block west along Themis Street to a small city park at the corner of Fountain Street. Add the letters of the last name of the person for whom the park is named. (You may follow the brick path to a display board.)

The park department granted permission to place the cache.

My grandfather served as Chief of Police in Sikeston for many years.  The playground equipment that you will find at this location was donated in honor of him and his relatives.  If you are lucky, some child may have left behind some castles in the sand for you to see, or you can make your own!

MULTICACHE INSTRUCTIONS:
You will find a sign at the listed coordinates.  For each letter that is substituted in the cache coordinates below, count up the number of times that you see that letter on the sign.  Put that number in place of each corresponding letter and then you will have the coordinates for the cache.

2009-10-25 Indigo500, I loved the concept for this multi cache.  I have to admit that Applesauce and I used the wrong sign at first and then we read some logs and realized our error.  Worked much better using the bronze sign.  
How cool to have this honor to your family.  
I have family from Sikestone - or had, I guess I should say.  My great grandparents were from Buckeye and Sikeston.  My grandfather and grandmother were married in Cape Girardeau and had both of their children while living in Sikeston.  My grandparents eventually settled in Indidnapolis, where I am from.  We used to come visit my great aunt Abbie Lee Morrison, who lived into her 90&apos;s.  
Applesauce and I cruised the old home place on Moore Avenue, and I was shocked to see that the place had been gentrified and is now a counselling office.  I was so happy to see it in such great shape.  Very cool.  Can&apos;t wait to show the pics to my aunt and cousin.
I might borrow this concept for a mulit in Indianapolis.  If I do, I&apos;ll give you credit!!!

Cache ID: GCWYRV
Multi-cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T1.0
DESC: Multicache located in the new Essex cemetery, but first, a visit to the old cemetery.
This is a multicache located in the small town of Essex, MO. First we&apos;ll head over to the old cemetery visible from the highway 60. You&apos;ll find some Hux family tombstones, one in front of the other. This family has been a large part of this town&apos;s community since it&apos;s foundation.

You&apos;ll need to find a few numbers. We&apos;ll label them A-G.
The first coordinate is 36° 48.(A)(B)(C)&apos;
(A) = The MONTH (in numeric format) Lewis (Toppy) F. Hux was born.
(B) = The MONTH Lewis (Toppy) F. Hux died.
(C) = The DAY Lewis (Toppy) F. Hux died MINUS (A).
Interesting day isn&apos;t it?

The second coordinate is 089° 51.(D)(E)(F)&apos;
(D) = (B)
(E) = The MONTH Dr. O.M. Hux died.
(F) = The MONTH Dr. O.M. Hux was born.

You&apos;ll probably want to get back in your car to find the solution in the new cemetery. The living Hux&apos;s already have their spots picked out!

Bring a pen/pencil.

Hint:
The cache is NOT located in or around anybody&apos;s grave site. Please be respectful to the graves. Good Luck!

This park was built to replace one of the same name a few years ago
after commercial activity blocked the original view. It&apos;s a great
place to have a picnic or just sit on a bench and watch the world

2009-10-22 KY_Geographer, The waterproof container disappeared. Someone attempted to replace it with an inferior, non-waterproof container that obviously didn&apos;t hold out.

DESC: 
Anyone who grew up in Western Kentucky from the 1960s through
the end of the century, probably remembers Candyland. Back then, a
trip down HWY 60 with our parents or grandparents included a stop
for candy. Now, you can buy just about every type of candy made in
the world at Wal-Mart but...it&apos;s just not the same. 
Clinton and Josephine Drury opened Candyland in 1962, which
they owned and operated until their retirement. Both are now
deceased. This cache honors them and the great candy that they
made.
Permission was obtained from the present owner to place this
cache. Ahhhhh, the good old days!
Hint: open the _____ and come on in!

SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: The walk is approximately 1/10 of a mile on easy terrain except for the last 200 ft which may contain sticker bushes, logs and some mud in the wet months. The path is fairly obvious from car to cache with hardpacked soil on most of the hike.
My father purchased this land from the executor of the Bonnie Rhodes estate in the early 80&apos;s He planned on using the farm as a source of fill material for a bid he won to build the approaches for a new bridge that you will see here. Later he decided that it was a nice area with a lot of history and decided to build the house you&apos;ll also see.  Ms. Rhodes home is no longer here but it used to set in front of the large Hackberry tree at the top of the hill.  Locals have told stories that Ms Rhodes and her husband decided to dig a root cellar behind the house and during their excavation started finding slabs of stone buried just a few feet down.  When they peeled back the slabs, human remains, pots and other items were discovered and they decided to just fill the area back in and not disturb any more than they already had.  When my father started the excavation in this area for the bridge approach he started finding broken pottery, animal bones, arrowheads and other such things.  Murray State University got wind of this and shut the bridge project down for two years so that they could do a site survey of the area and learn more about the people who used to live here.  The survey concluded that the people were referred to as &quot;The Mississipians&quot; They normally lived in the main river valleys throughout the Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers from about 1250-1350 A.D.  but can date back as far as 900A.D.  The pond located at this site used to be a grown up slough that always contained water.  The survey states that the Mississippians most likely packed baskets of dirt out of the slough to create the hill that my families house now sits on.  The existing house has a few features of the old Rhodes house inside.  We used one of the 12x12 hand hewn timbers that used to support the Rhodes house as a fireplace mantle.  Several jars of square handmade nails were also collected and I believe a few were actually driven into some of the lumber that they used when building the house in 1987.  The most interesting part of growing up in that house was some of the &quot;hauntings&quot; that still go on today.  I&apos;ve never been one to believe in ghosts or really anything that cannot be explained scientifically but I personally have listened to the piano play in the wee hours of the morning (and its not a player piano) My friends and I watched doors slam right in front of our eyes and these are doors that could not move on their own due to the carpet slightly rubbing the bottom of the frame...they had to be pushed with some force to get them to even move.  My friend stayed in our guest room when we were younger and he came and asked me who that indian looking guy was standing outside his window last night and he had no knowledge of anything that I&apos;ve just described here to put that into his head.  If anything strange ever happens in the house my father and mother both just chock it up to their native american guests.  I hope you enjoy my first attempt at hiding a cache.  Keep your eyes to the ground at both areas because you can still find broken pottery and arrowheads strewn around. Both my parents know about this cache and won&apos;t bug you but if you see them out they may have some more stories they can tell you.  Lots of locals like to fish in the pond so if you want you can bring your pole.

2009-09-05 Influence Waterfowl Calls, Last time I went past this cache it was dark so I just kept on trucking!  My boy and I hoofed it out there and the GPSr said it was 2 feet away and I saw nothing.  Because of the briers I had him stay out of the woods and I could not see him.  So I checked the hint and it matched up with where I was and no cache.  I gave the owner a ring and he added that what the hint spoke of had a different trait than what I was looking at which helped me make the find.  My 60CSx said I was 30 feet off!  Thanks for the hint and the cache!  Oh big man traded so kid safety goggles for a tiny frog and tiny dino!  Thanks again!

2009-01-12 CyclonicKWF, This is my first cache of the New Year!  It turns out that third times the charm for this one.  I had made 2 previous attempts, but had not found the cache for varying reasons.  Today I was in Benton getting our van serviced, so I thought I should try this one again even if I did not have the best outfit for Geocaching.  This one is out by itself so it does not get much traffic.  It definitely was much easier to find in the winter with the undergrowth dead.  However the thorns from the blackberries were still present.  When I first arrived to the location I was taken to the same wood piles.  Then when I looked around I saw the cache.  Getting to it still proved to be tricky because of the thorns.  I did not swap anything and signed the log.  Then I replaced the container and headed on my way.  Thanks for the cache and the wonderful History lesson.

I suspected where it might be, but it is always nice to have coordinates.  When we arrived at the parking area there were 2 trucks with horse trailers parked there.  It seems they were horse back riding on the property.  Figuring we would be gone by the time they got back we headed off.  We made it to the woods and were greeted by numerous blackberry bushes and heavy undergrowth.  After searching for awhile we had to bail.  The growth was just too thick.  Geo-K did get some blackberries while we searched!  [:)]  We will have to come back during the winter.

of bushwhacking. Parking is at the archery range, which is 100
yards away from the firearms range parking;  shooting is in the
opposite direction of the cache. Your hike will not take you near
the range or the range safety zone. Long pants are recommended due
to blackberry and wild rose.
Walk across the meadow to the power line cut, which will make
your hike much easier than a straight-line bushwhack from the
parking area.

DESC: Apple Creek Conservation Area Horse Trail is a multi-use trail 5
miles in length. Cache is located off one of the trail loops.
Expect multiple elevations changes, some gravel paths, some hard
packed paths, dry creek crossing and a bushwhack at the end. If you
ride horses, this would be a great cache to take your horse on.

Apple Creek Conservation Area is a multi-purpose use area,
including hunting. This cache is NOT recommended during firearms
deer season. Hunter orange vests and hat are recommended during any
other hunting seasons (turkey and archery deer).
First stage is not a cache and does not count as a find;  it is
coordinates for the cache, which should be easier to find than the
First Stage.
You can travel MOST of the distance to the cache by following
the equestrian trails OR you can do a 1/4 mile bushwhack. Before
you decide to do either, walk East, .51 miles, to the fork in the
trail. If you cut off to the South before this time, you will end
up crossing private property which borders Apple Creek Conservation
Area.
This is a Book Crossing Cache. There are as many books as I
could fit in a 7.62mm Ammo Box, a log book and a few swag items.
Take a book and leave a book;  trade some swag or just sign the log.
Each book is registered with Bookcrossing.com and has a unique
ID Number.
Cache started with:

You might consider registering any books you bring to trade with
Bookcrossing.com, though it is
not a requirement. 
Additional hints will be posted 1 week after FTF.
This area is open from 4.00am to 10.00pm.
Apple Creek consists of forests, wetlands, croplands and old
fields. In various areas you can find a boat ramp, primitive
camping, firearms/archery range, multiple fishing ponds and a
permanent stream.

Found it
2008-01-26 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on the last weekend of January, with the hours of daylight getting longer every week. “Uphill both ways”, I think that pretty well describes it. We like hiking, up to a point, and we definitely reached that point with this cache – I was tired by the time we finished. 

We followed the trail eastward until reaching the fork to the south, then down the hill and up the other side to the waypoint. We didn&apos;t know whether we&apos;d be able to identify a sassafras stick at WP1 if we saw it, but that wasn&apos;t a problem. We collected the coordinates of the final and headed in that direction. By the time I got there, Mean Gene had already found the cache and was ready to sign it for us. 

We looked at the topo map we&apos;d picked up at the trailhead and decided the best way back was the way we&apos;d come, so we reversed our route. I lost sight of Mean Gene once I got to the hill heading back up to the ridge, but met up with him again at the car. A group of beagles and their hunter-owners were just heading down the trail as I got back to the trailhead. Whew! TNLNSL. Thanks, JohnTee and Ryan! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO

2007-12-02 LennyTheLizard, Drove half way across Perry County to finally pick up this cache.  Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t check my seasons first.  There were two vehicles parked nearby, and I figured I would brave the bow hunters, but a gunshot nearby confirmed that it was muzzle loader season.  Luckily, we were still in the parking lot so we turned around and went home.  Good thing, less than 10 minutes later it started pouring rain.  Will try again soon!

The Juden Creek Natural History Area connects to the I.R. Kelso Wildlife Sanctuary at the north edge of Cape Girardeau, Mo. near the Mississippi River.  A trail is situated along a steep bluff through tulip poplar, beech, northern red oak and shagbark hickory. The area is utilized by students and faculty of Southeast Missouri State University.
  
From the north, the area can be reached from Highway 177 near the city limits. A Missouri Department of Conservation sign directs toward the parking lot. Cross the one-lane bridge over Juden Creek and the area will be on the right.
  
From the south, the area can be reached after passing by Cape Rock Park.
  
The cache is located about one-half mile from the parking lot. Expect at least a 15-minute walk up the trail that is steep in places. Extra care should be taken during wet conditions.
  
The coordinates mark the spot where the clue will be needed to find the off-set cache.
  
The welcome sign at the parking lot will provide the clue to the cache location.
  
Using the last group listed on the sign, find the letters to spell out the clue:

This trail was created as part of an environmental education

practicing for the school&apos;s cross-country team. It&apos;s perfect for a
nice (0.2-mile-or-so each way) stroll through the woods.

Yeah, um, no.  Normally I don&apos;t shrink from a challenge, but considering the vast amounts of poison oak at ground zero (not to mention the rash I&apos;m still trying to get rid of), I&apos;m going to have to call this one a DNF.  But it&apos;s a nice area - I hope the school or community are able to clean it up in the near future.  You can tell what it used to be like before the ice storm.

This cache wasn&apos;t as hard as we had feared.  Also, ticks in the tall grass appeared to be a misplaced fear as well (although I did manage to pick up one of the little guys by the time Smee and I got home).  The hint helped a lot-- thanks!  Also, I think I dated the log July 30 intead of the 29th.  Smee straightened me out on that one.

2009-07-27 deercreekth, My first Morganfield find is a special one as it is the closest cache to my parents&apos; house.  It&apos;s also the first cemetery I&apos;ve ever cached in that I know a relative is buried in.  My Great Grandfather is buried here, but there is no tombstone.  As I saw the cemetery from the road, I didn&apos;t think it looked bad.  I didn&apos;t realize how high the weeds were until I walked into them.  Luckily the cache was in a good spot and I came up with it quickly. 

People may think the cemetery looks bad, but it has looked worse.  The Methodist Men&apos;s group including my Grandfather cleaned it up several years ago.  Tombstones had fallen over, and it was in really bad shape.  Someone from that group kept up with mowing it for a few years, but it looks like that has stopped.  There used to still be a sign hanging near the road, but something&apos;s happened to it.  Thanks for placing a cache here.

The real challenge at this site finding a place to park. By the time I found a place that wouldn&apos;t put us in the path of a combine, Lumberjack Tom had the cache found and the log signed.  Thanks for the fun!
Found it
2009-07-29 Lumberjack Tom, Union County, formed in 1811 when it was cut out of Henderson County, was given its name to show off its patriotism prior to the War of 1812.  The name &quot;Union&quot; turned out turned out to be less apt than originally expected, however, when, at old Caseyville on the Ohio River, the crew of a Union gunboat took every inhabitant of the pro-Southern town prisioner in July, 1862.  They took 19 men to Evansville to guarantee payment of $35,000 in damage done by rebel guerillas.  Old Kentucky laughed to himself when he first heard about that matter, but knew full well that only time afforded him that luxury.  Where would he have stood had he been in Union County at that time?

Found as part of the Kentucky County Challenge.

At this site it was just Smee and me-- and the wind blowing through a million anonymous cornstalks.  Great coords and a nicely placed little cache.  Thanks!

Located in downtown Morganfield, the cache is in view of the

being built). The current jail is further down the street between
the two buildings. The cache is NOT on any building store fronts.
This is a high muggle area thru the week and stealth is required.
Cache is available 24/7 but muggles should decrease after 5 p.m.
Not my ordinary type of cache (gotten away from the water themes)
but will surely get a rise out of all who find it. Bring your own

Cache ID: GCTFV6
Multi-cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T2.0
DESC: This is a two-stage multicache located near Possum Trot, KY, an easy start in an old cemetery.
Starting from US Highway 62 in Possum Trot, KY, turn North on Little Cypress Rd.  In about a mile it jogs left and again to the right.  Be cautious about crossing the active double railroad tracks as there is no signal.  Stop at the cemetery.

The first set of coordinates takes you to a 3 1/2 foot tall, rectangular marble marker that tells of the tragic death of a young man at age 17.  The inscription likely was chosen by a distraught and bitter mother.  Use the dates you see, to modify the second set of coordinates:

N36 10.922   To the 10 add the last two digits for the year Charles was born.

W 088 25.420  To the 42 add the date in November on which this tragedy took place.

The modified set of coordinates will take you to another cemetery less than two miles South of Possum Trot on Highway 1610.  Here you will find the cache, a 2-quart camo thermos containing a log and the usual goodies.  No graves need to be disturbed.  Be sure to rehide the cache well, especially in the winter.  Be respectful of the area.

After finding the cache, stop by the southwest corner of this small cemetery at what I call a very obvious &quot;Doorway to Heaven,&quot; a huge marble door-shaped STORY family monument.  This monument towers about eight feet above ground level.  Have you ever thought about how much tombstones weigh?  Marble weighs about 200 pounds per cubic foot.  The lowest base stone alone, weighs 2,800 pounds!  This monument, including the two base pieces, by calculation weighs over eight thousand pounds, much more than the vehicle you are driving.  That is a lot of rock!

(you can see the doorway after which this monument was patterned if you will go to downtown Paducah, on Broadway, and pick up the cache &quot;Full of Grace.&quot;

2009-07-29 Lumberjack Tom, Henderson County was formed in 1798 and is named for Colonel Richard Henderson of the Transylvania Company.  Henderson, the county seat, is located in a deep bend in the Ohio River and was originally called &quot;Re Banks.&quot;  Old Kentucky saw a true state irony in Henderson County being one of Kentucky&apos;s wealthiest counties, due to largely to coal and oil.  The eastern part of the state, where coal is king, must be envious, he thought.

2009-11-01 Team Nosoman, We were here in the spring just after the big storms and the trail was closed.  We thought we would try again once we heard that it was open again.  Still surprised at the number of BIG trees that were literally pulled out of the ground by their roots.  The trail was an muddy obstacle course and we had to deviate from the main path sometimes but we made it.  The cache does need maintenance for the wet, black growing log but the container is OK as is the hiding spot.  SL  TFTC

 <desc>Beyond Crow Knob by GEO.JOE
Cache ID: GC12Y8H
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T2.5
DESC: Crow Knob is a nice example of a relatively natural sandstone
glade, and it was a link in the underground railroad.
To reach the cache you will first have to go to the top of Crow
Knob. The top is reached by a series of stair step ledges in the
sand stone (watch out for wet areas they will be slick). Parking
and access to the top of Crow Knob is located near N37 29.906 W88
37.954. There is also an old trail on the North East side that
comes through the woods to the back side of Crow Knob if you would
like to make a loop go north of the cache until you see the trail.


In the fall this is a great place to see the changing leaves and
there are great views especially in the winter. Crow Knob also has
a historical link to the Underground Railroad. Residents of the
nearby community of Miller Grove would light fires on top of Crow
Knob to guide runaway slaves. The residents would hide the escaped
slaves at nearby Sand Cave and assist them in moving further north.


Crow Knob can be reached by a minimally maintained forest service
road 423A (N37 29.418 W88 38.455). In fair weather the road is
possibly passable in cars but a high clearance vehicle is
recommended. Following prolonged or heavy rain muddy areas will
develop, wash areas may develop on hills and a creek crossing may
wash out, so know your vehicle&apos;s limitations. 

Crow Knob is one mile from the blacktop and the road would make for
a nice hike or bike ride. The River to River trail follows part of
road, therefore, you will share the road with hikers and horses.
Please be courteous to horses, pull to the side and shut off your
engine as they pass.

2007-12-28 KroBro, On a three day caching trip with Panther in the Den and badlands.

Came over from &quot;Sand Cave&quot; cache. Tried to make the drive through but was halted part way by obstacles. It&apos;s ok as we love to hike these terrains anyway.

While heading in, we saw some recent signs on some trees of animal activity. Had the eyes open then hoping to spot some creatures. Neared gz and spotted a dog that quickly ran off. We all took different routes in and I was the first to spot the cache. I left it alone and sat nearby waiting for my partners to arrive. badlands came next, and then Panther in the Den followed afterwards. He had carried the lost dog up the hill and the critter came running by me wagging it&apos;s tail happy to see some people.

We signed in and went over to the point of the knob to take in it&apos;s beauty. The dog which we named KiD (&quot;Knobby in the Den&quot; which coincides with &quot;Panther in the Den&quot;) followed us all the way out. Took some pics of this splendid area and strolled back to the car. Another quality GEO.JOE cache! Thanks so much for your effort with these fine hides.

P.S. The next day, we hike &quot;Panther Den&quot; wilderness. Panther in the Den takes his namesake from there. It is a awesome area without any cache. Maybe GEO.JOE could contact &quot;Panther in the Den&quot; for points of interest there. It surely needs some hides as it is a fantastic area.

Thanks again for the fun GEO.JOE....you rock!
Found it
2007-12-28 Panther in the Den, Out on a three day caching spree with badlands and Krobro.

Another awesome spot in the trio that we did in the area.

Used the road as recommended but the road car was not up to the task of fully navigating all of the way to the parking.

Had a nice stroll and along the way we found a lost dog. Please contact me with a description and I will arrange a safe return.

Once at the spot there were several approaches and we all took our own and we took even another way back as we hiked over to the top of the namesake formation.

Great location and story! I will recommend this one to all.

Thanks for the cache!

2009-11-07 myotis, This was pretty neat.  Headed for the cache and saw it was on the Stan Harris Trail.  That was neat because I know Stan but did not know there was a trail named after him.  Then about an hour latter I saw Stan and we went hiking.  


Heading down to Southern IL and did some nice caches on the way down.  Thanks for the great caches.

2009-11-03 TsukiakariUsagi, Dirtpride and I found this one right off the path, but the cache was almost impossible to open, has become pretty rusty, and all the logs were pretty wet and waterlogged so we didn&apos;t sign it.  TFTC!  One cache in Carbondale remains...

Found it
2009-10-31 Crazy4Moose, Cycle Ken and I traveled to Southern IL on this nice SUNNY Halloween day to visit family, attend a festival, and of course, grab some geocaches.  Decided not to change into my hiking boots for this short walk, but that was a mistake.  The trail was really wet in a few places after all the recent rain.  We could see the debris left behind by the inland hurricane that went through earlier this year.  We were having a lot of trouble with this one - thankfully I was able to pull up past logs and saw that the tree had fallen - so we revised our search.  Then we were able to come up with the cache.  TFTC.

This outdoor military equipment museum is located behind the Jackson Medical Center, 2387 West Jackson Blvd., about two-tenths mile west of Pioneer Market, in Jackson, Mo.

Dr. Charles Pewitt created the memorial to be an interactive history lesson. He received approval from the U.S. Army to buy demilitarized equipment for the display. No admission is charged.

The memorial consists of an M109 howitzer propelled gun from the Vietnam era (next to the building), M551 Sheridan light tank (U.S. Army 1966-1997), a World War II-era M42 Duster tank, an M114 Command and Reconnaissance Carrier from the Vietnam era, three cannons from 1820s British warships and a Civil War cannon.

In addition, the museum has an M38 training warhead from an Army weapon called Honest John. This weapon was developed in 1951 and was deployed in 1954. Between 1960 and 1965, over 7,000 missiles were produced. It was used by the U.S. Army in Greece, Turkey and South Korea. It could carry conventional or nuclear warheads. It was a free-flight (unguided), mobile, surface-to-surface, short-range weapon with a maximum range of only 23.6 miles.

The Honest John was not very accurate. It was affected considerably by low-level winds. It had to be warmed by electric blankets for 24-48 hours prior to launch if the temperature was less than 77 degrees F. This provided the enemy ample time to detect launch preparations and to react accordingly. The system was declared obsolete in 1982 and deactivated.

This is a micro multi-cache. The published coordinates begin at the warhead, behind the medical building, where parking is also available. A separate road from the highway leads to the rear of the building and to the museum. 

These coordinates mark the equipment needed to complete the clues:

Sheridan: N37 22.977  W089 42.007
Duster: N37 22.973  W089 42.028
Carrier: N37 22.974  W089 42.038

Follow the clues to find the missing numbers to the cache coordinates:

N37 23.???     W089 42.???

Add the number of LARGE wheels inside one track of the Sheridan tank to the TOTAL number of wheels (including sprocket wheels) inside one track of the Duster tank. Multiply the sum by the number of stars on the Command Carrier. (Important: Disregard the star on top if you see one!) Multiply the result by 10.

Using this answer, find the markings on the warhead and subtract the three-digit &quot;date loaded.&quot; Subtract 325 from this answer. Then add the result to the last three digits of the &quot;part number.&quot;

Use these three digits to complete both north and west coordinates.

Dr. Pewitt granted permission to place the cache.

DESC: The cache IS located at the above coordinates.  This cache is located, just 700 ft or so from ?and then the fish could see? on the New Mckendree United Metthodist Church South Campus.  The terrain can be muddy at times;  there are many inclines, and declines.  You will be looking for a green plastic ammo box.   .
PLEASE REPLACE THE CACHE JUST AS YOU FOUND IT AND MAKE SURE THE LOCK IS LOCKED,  SOMETIMES IT IS KIND OF HARD TO LOCK.  THANKS

This is a fairly easy find, but there is one problem.  I put a ?word lock? combination lock on the box, and threw away the combination. The combination has a total of four letters


1.	Option number 1;  I have hidden the letters of the combination in different words within the desccription of this cache.  You must again find these letters and descramble them to unlock the box.  You might want to read the cache description very carefully, 

I will put option 2 up if I find option one is to difficult.

Once you open the box, I have put numerrous things in the box.  

1 Texaco limited edition collector?s bank

1 Jeremy Verhines compact disk

2 coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Buckner?s brewing compaany

5 or 6 pieces of software 

1 power strip

And I can?t remember what else

2009-08-18 Coordinated Raptor, This was quite a bushwack at this time of year.  Looks like the ice storm last winter did a lot of damage in these woods and made it nearly impossible to follow the trail.  After wading through lots of spiderwebs, poison ivy and tons of under growth we finally found it.  The box was closed but we found several items on the ground around the stump.  The inside of the box was wet and getting nasty.  It is really in need of a good cleaning up.  TNLNSL

Cache ID: GC112BZ
Earthcache
SIZE: Not chosen
D1.0/T1.0
DESC: Welcome to Reelfoot Lake!  The lake was formed by a series of earthquakes from the New Madrid Fault.  Girl Scouts from troops 1629 and 1632 researched the lake&apos;s formation during a three-week study of letterboxing and geocaching.
Reelfoot Lake is located in the northwest corner of Tennessee.  A series of earthquakes formed Reelfoot Lake during the bitter winter of 1811 and 1812.  

Reelfoot Lake was once a swamp, regularly flooded by the Mississippi River.  During the last 6,000 years the river has changed its course many times, leaving behind bodies of stranded water called oxbow lakes.

Reelfoot Lake probably was once a series of oxbow lakes.  Then earthquakes 70 miles southwest of the lake, near the settlement of New Madrid, Mo., enlarged the land&apos;s low-lying basin. The quakes could be felt for one million square miles, from as far north as Canada to as far south as New Orleans.

Landslides swept down bluffs, large areas of land were uplifted, and still larger areas of land sank.  One of these sunken areas filled with water, and Reelfoot Lake was born.  People who lived near the Mississippi River said it appeared that the river ran backward for days as the water poured into the new lake.

The quakes also uplifted the area called the Tiptonville Dome.  This runs below the south end of the lake, and it helped keep water from draining out of the area.  

One major earthquake happened on Dec. 16, 1811. It measured 8.6 on the Richter scale.  The next one was on Jan. 23, 1812.  It measured 8.4.  Finally, a quake Feb. 7, 1812, measured 8.7.  Few lives were lost as the area was sparsely settled.  

The lake covers 15,000 acres in water.  Reelfoot Lake is now well known for hunting and fishing.  

The New Madrid Fault, from which the earthquakes originated, is still active today.  In recent decades, minor earthquakes have occurred.  Scientists think that in the next 50 years there is likely to be a quake with a magnitude greater than 7.0 on the Richter scale.  This could destroy the levee and spillway system that isolated the lake from the Mississippi River. If the area lifted up, the lake would drain.  A major earthquake could also potentially destroy the city of Memphis, Tenn., which was not built when the last major quakes occurred.  

To get credit for finding this cache, e-mail the answers to the following questions to the cache owner.

What time of day did the &quot;hard shock&quot; occur?

How many recorded tremors were there?

At what interval do scientists predict powerful earthquakes will occur in this area?

Cache ID: GC10XHP
Multi-cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.0/T4.5
DESC: Cache is located in the town of Old Kuttawa, along the shoreline of Lake Barkley.  The change in elevation from the closest parking is rather severe, but the path is paved and worth the walk.
This cache is my first multi.  The following information will be needed to complete your task and retrieve the actual cache.

Along the route to the first point there are a number of man-made features, all of them are the same, are white and can not be missed.  Count these on your way up.  Once at the first location you will again see some man made features/items.  There are two sizes.  Count the small ones, count the large ones, determine how many small ones are associated with each of the large items and how many total small objects there are.  Take a moment to enjoy the view, it is the real reason I wanted to bring people here.  

The following will need to be used to determine the cache location.  A=the number of small man-made items at the first location.  B=the number of small items surrounding one of the large items.  C=the number of man-made items counted on the route up to piont one.  

The final location is 37° 0B.CA2 N 088° 07.02A W  

You will find that you passed the final location on the way up to point number one.

Note:  Summit Drive, along ridgeline is closed to vehicle traffic.  Have changed the Terrain Rating due to the severe elevation change.

DESC: GO TAKE A WALK! and do a series of geocaches along Cape Girardeau&apos;s
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail. This is Part Three of a series of
caches along the trail, numbered as placed, and NOT in any sequence
along the trail. 
The walk is all paved asphalt, with few, gentle inclines and
occasional bridges. Trail open from 6:00 a.m. ? 11:00 p.m.
The recreation trail is a very popular place when the weather is
the least bit nice. You can expect walkers, joggers and bicyclists.
Be aware of muggles as you cache along the trail. 
This is a micro, log and pencil included. You&apos;ll have to do a
little bit of looking, but it&apos;s not bad. It is not handicapped
accessible.
The recreation trail can be accessed from multiple points in
Cape Girardeau - time to explore! Eventually, you will be able to
geocache multiple caches, from one end to the trail to the other.

Be sure you don&apos;t miss other caches in the area.
Accuracy
Eight sets of coordinates, from two different days, with an average
12&apos; Estimated Position Error (EPE)were averaged to give the final
set listed here.
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail
 For joggers, walkers, bicyclists, rollerbladers and skateboarders,
the 4.4-mile asphalt Cape La Croix Recreation Trail connects the
Osage Community Centre on the north and Shawnee Park Sports Complex
on the south, while avoiding the need to cross city streets. It
provides users with a safe recreational experience as it skirts the
banks of the Cape La Croix Creek.
For more information on the trail, visit the 
Cape Girardeau Parks and Recreation web page.
Permission to place geocaches in Cape Girardeau Parks was
obtained from Dan Muser, Parks and Recreation Department.

I&apos;m about to rename this to, &quot;NOT A ZIP-LOC CACHE&quot;. Come on folks,

Be aware of muggles as you cache along the trail. 
This is a micro, log and pencil included. Just to be up front,
this is potentially a difficult cache, of a type I&apos;ve not done or
seen done in this area. Another one of those think outside of the
box ideas! If you get frustrated with it, drop me an e-mail and
I&apos;ll see if I can nudge you in the right direction. It can be done
from the trail and should be handicapped accessible.
The recreation trail can be accessed from multiple points in
Cape Girardeau - time to explore! Eventually, you will be able to
geocache multiple caches, from one end to the trail to the other.

Be sure you don&apos;t miss other caches in the area. There is a
parking lot immediately west of this geocache - it is apparently a
loading area and marked &quot;Private
Parking&quot; and should NOT be used. You should be able to park
in front of the businesses without problem.
Handicaching Information
There are two parking sites listed for anyone doing only this
cache. The first:
BP01 is located off Kingshighway and is (at the absolutely closest
parking spot) 200&apos; from the cache. It involves traversing 100&apos; of
gravel parking lot from the coord&apos;s.
BP02 is located off Brink Avenue. It has immediate, paved access to
the trail and is 0.31 miles from the cache.
Accuracy
Eleven sets of coordinates, with 10-14&apos; EPE, from three different
dates, were averaged to give the final set listed here.

I am one of the volunteer Kentucky geocache reviewers.

I&apos;ve been going through geocaches that have been disabled or had a Needs Maintenance attribute for over 4 weeks.

If you have plans of replacing or repairing this one in the near future, please let the geocaching community know by placing a note on the cache page. Once you are able to repair, please post an owner maintenance note and re-enable your geocache.  If you have decided not to replace or repair the cache, please archive the listing.

2009-03-19 GEO.JOE, I had a meeting at the Wingo Ele. school this afternoon so I brought my bike with plans to get all the caches on the trail. However, the trail has only been cleared up to this cache. The log is almost full on this one, but other than that the cache is in fine shape. 

My hat is off to LZ33 and Michigan Chris for continuing on down the trail. I was under the allusion that I could do it since they did it. Well I don&apos;t know them but I do know they like caching more than I do. : ) The trail past this cache is a tangle of trees going all different directions with limbs grabbing at me and tripping me and jabbing me in the head, so this is the last cache that I got today. That still leaves plenty of caches for me to make a return trip for.

2009-05-07 RickBlick &amp; Chick, Walked past &apos;Butterfly Ridge&apos; to make that # 1500 for our milestone climb, and came down to this cache after the &apos;Traffic Signal&apos;.  Had it marked in my notes that this may need another container, but forgot about grabbing it from the bag of tricks as I left the vehicle.

Found the cache filled with water and log soaked.  Unrolled the log about half way and layed it on a branch to dry.  Also found a toy car laying on the ground, but so sign of the top to the decon container.  Put a couple small sheets of paper in a new baggie and positioned the container upside down. 

Proceeded from here to another cache down the trail, and found another toy car about 20 feet from this cache.  After finding the other cache down the trail, I returned here and fashioned a lid made of bark, with a slab of wood stuck into the fence below the cache to keep the contents from falling out, now that it is upside down.  Also, the log did not dry at all, so trashed it and the old baggie.

2009-03-18 GEO.JOE, Well I was going to replace the container but I did not make it to the cache. The trail is still a mess just past the signal trail. It was just too much trouble to work my way through the fallen trees so I turned around and headed back out.

We stopped at the Cache Chapel  just down the road for a look around before we got here. It was a pretty neat church and old cemetery. We made a quick find of the cache all was dry and I was shocked to see a TB in there. The cache river was smaller than I expected. I have been on the cache river about 3 miles east and it was larger there then is at this bridge.

USE THESE COORDINATES FOR CALCULATIONS
S37.347583
E90.40385
Those of you who know me, know that an accurate set of
coordinates is very important to me. Something happened between
placing this cache, shooting and averaging 16 sets of coordinates
and posting it on GC.com. The coordinates seem to be a little bit
off. Not sure if my GPSr was wanky, or I transposed something along
the way. You&apos;re going to have to use the information on this page
to try and fix my problem and find the cache. The &apos;Hint&apos; will give
you some ideas of what direction to go (Google &amp;amp;  Wikipedia are
your friends), but will not help you in the field.
Once you&apos;ve figured out the puzzle, please don&apos;t post the
coordinates in your log. If you won&apos;t post the coordinates, I won&apos;t
delete your log.

You can check your answers for this puzzle on

2009-11-07 GEO.JOE, Real pretty area, we really enjoyed the walk along the creek to the cache. We were losing daylight so we did not linger long. We thought we were going to get a couple more caches but it was getting dark way to quick for that so this turns out to be the last cache of the day for us. We dropped a TB in the cache the traveler is no longer on the tag though, but it is still able to travel. Thanks for sharing the area with us.

DESC: The cache is a micro cache hidden in one of many parks in Perryville. This cache got its name from the fact that this park floods after a heavy rain.  But the cache will still be obtainable even then,  so good luck and have fun.  I used the tool to determine the terrain and difficulty but i think the numbers are a bit high. I feel an experieced cacher could make a quick find here.

Greetings,

I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled, or has not been found for a period of time. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can&apos;t do so forever. When you get a chance, please either repair/replace this cache, or archive it (using the [i]archive listing [/i] link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

If you plan on repairing this cache, please [b] log a note to the cache [/b] (not email) so I don&apos;t archive the listing for non-communication. I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache. [b]If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.[/b]

If the [B][RED]Needs Maintenance[/B][/RED] attribute is showing you will need to also write a [B][GREEN]Owners Maintenance[/B][/GREEN] note to remove it. http://support.groundspeak.com/Support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=333&amp;nav=0,5,15

OCW K-Team and N0WNV.  Talk about a cold day!!!  And the wind!!  What a day to be caching-we must be insane.  In the teens and 50 mph winds.  Did I mention how cold it was?  We headed down to Perryville and the Cape and had a great and cold time.  Lots of really nice caches.  But it was cold.  Thanks for all the great caches.

2009-09-06 capegcachers, Probably wouldn&apos;t have even tried this if we noticed it hadn&apos;t been found in over a year.  I&apos;m assuming it was in one of the rock piles.  Our GPS was jumping all around.  Not a fan of caches in rocks.  Not sure if it was here and we just didn&apos;t find it, or AWOL, since it hasn&apos;t been found in a really long time.  If it&apos;s still there we definitely will need some help to get it.

SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T3.0
DESC: Ideal cache for travellers because it is located right off Interstate 55 &amp; Highway 61 at the Cape Girardeau - Jackson Exit - Mile Marker 99. Terrain is not too difficult and no need to bushwack. Bring a picnic lunch and enjoy the view while caching. Nice, and although somewhat secluded park area, it is driven by quite often throughout the day.
We have placed our 1st TB, Drifter, in this cache. Hopefully, many TB&apos;s can stop off at the TB Inn. We hope that Geocacher&apos;s will trade TB&apos;s and not just take the ones that are in the cache. And please, if you take a TB, be sure to log it ASAP so that fellow Geocacher&apos;s can have the opportunity to look for it. 

The cache is stuffed full of goodies, with something for everyone! 
Please replace (c
over) the cache exactly as you found it.

PLEASE DO NOT RAID THE CACHE BY TAKING MULTIPLE ITEMS WITHOUT LEAVING SOMETHING IN ITS PLACE!! LEAVE SOME FUN FOR OTHER FELLOW GEOCACHER&apos;S!!

This cache is going to require a specific TOTT to retrieve. DO
NOT DISASSEMBLE OR OTHERWISE TAKE APART ANY STRUCTURE AROUND THE
CACHE - PLEASE USE THE CORRECT TOTT. Unless you are in the
habit of carrying a wide array of TOTT&apos;s with you, the cache may be
unobtainable. Study the description to try and figure out which
TOTT this cache will require. I won&apos;t leave vague hints for
something that requires anything not readily available. There&apos;s
usually more than one way to skin a cat;  some work better than
others. If you have time and inclination, I would be interested in
an e-mail about the TOTT you used for this cache. 
&quot;Bueller? ...Bueller? ...Bueller?&quot; &quot;Anyone? Anyone?&quot;
What a gorgeous day today;  it was truly a &quot;Ferrous Bueller&apos;s Day
Off&quot; kind of day. As I was out driving about, the question that
came to me wasn&apos;t &quot;what are we going to do,&quot; the question is &quot;what
aren&apos;t we going to do?&quot; Then I got to thinking about the trouble
Ferrous (Matthew Broderick) gets into with his friends Cameron Frye
(Alan Ruck) and Sloane Peterson (Mia Neodymium) as their day went
on. It suddenly came to me that I had actually SEEN the red Ferrari
used in the movie;  it was hanging in a &apos;Planet Hollywood&apos; in &apos;Mall
of America&apos;. Man, what a place! And, how about that strange
attraction between Ferrous and Sloane?! Then I realize, Hey! this
is only about a mile from my &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot; cache!
In Geocaching, &apos;Tools of the Trade&apos; (TOTT) are any of the MANY
devices that might be used to help find/retrieve/log a geocache.
Below is a list that is NOT all inclusive, that you should consult,
along with the cache description.
Tools of the Trade
ATV/SUV
 Ball of string or twine
 Boat/canoe/kayak
 Cellphone (Phone-A-Friend option)
 Compas
 Digital camera and an extra battery
 Duct Tape
 Flashlight/s
 Junior Geo-Rangers
 Laptop/Phone/PDA with WiFi
 Leatherman type multi-tool
 Magnet/Metal washer
 Maps of various types
 Mechanics extendable magnet
 Mechanics remote pickup
 Mirror (for looking where you don&apos;t want to put your hands
first)
 PDA/Phone with geocaching software
 Pole/Break down metal rod with a hook on the end for probing under
and unseen areas first
 Rock Climbing Gear
 Rope, various lengths
 SCUBA Gear
 Tweezers (for getting logs out of very small containers)
 Water, various amounts
 Wire coat hanger, straightened out
 Work Gloves (for reaching where I can&apos;t see)
 Wrenches &amp;amp;  Screwdrivers
Logs, or pictures, that give away the specific TOTT run the risk
of being deleted!
I&apos;m open to suggestions regarding the cache rating . . .
Over 250 waypoints were averaged, from two different times of
day, for the final set.

It&apos;s components were actually on the list in the description and sounds like it worked very nicely. There is not necessarily only ONE TOTT that will work on some of these caches, but there may be one that will work better than others. [:D]

DESC: GO TAKE A WALK! and do a series of geocaches along Cape Girardeau&apos;s
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail. This is Part Eight (brought back)
of a series of caches along the trail, numbered as placed, and NOT
in any sequence along the trail. 
The walk is all paved asphalt, with few, gentle inclines and
occasional bridges. Trail open from 6:00 a.m. ? 11:00 p.m.
This is a quick and easy &apos;Park and Grab&apos; located just off the
walking trail, very near to the location of the original &quot;Go Take A
Walk! Part Eight&quot;. It can be accessed off Shawnee Parkway through
the baseball complex or from the soccer fields access at the end of
Rust Blvd. 
The recreation trail is a very popular place when the weather is
the least bit nice. You can expect walkers, joggers and bicyclists.
Be aware of muggles as you cache along the trail.
This is a micro, log and pencil included. It is handicapped
accessible.
The recreation trail can be accessed from multiple points in
Cape Girardeau - time to explore! Eventually, you will be able to
geocache multiple caches, from one end to the trail to the other.
Be sure you don&apos;t miss other caches in the area.
Accuracy 185 sets of coordinates, with an average 10&apos;
Estimated Position Error (EPE) were averaged to give the final set
listed here.
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail For joggers, walkers,
bicyclists, rollerbladers and skateboarders, the 4.4-mile asphalt
Cape La Croix Recreation Trail connects the Osage Community Centre
on the north and Shawnee Park Sports Complex on the south, while
avoiding the need to cross city streets. It provides users with a
safe recreational experience as it skirts the banks of the Cape La
Croix Creek.
For more information on the trail, visit the

Cape Girardeau Parks and Recreation web page.
Permission to place geocaches in Cape Girardeau Parks
wasobtained from Dan Muser, Parks and Recreation Department.

2009-12-08 myotis, With the pouring rain and in the 30s, I decided I would check out the 3 obvious posibilities and give up if it was not there.  It was not (or it was well hid) so after looking for 2 minutes, I decided this one would be saved for another day.

DESC: 
The only way to this cache is by following Big Grand Pierre Creek.  I suggest you park at Parkinson Mine rather than try to access the cache from the Ohio River or to park near the Golconda Job Corps and stay on US Forest land.  You cannot access the cache from the east because there is a strip of private land from Highway 146 to the Ohio River.  There is national forest land along the creek from Parkinson Mine to the cache.  

This area is frequented by hunters during deer season so you might want to avoid this cache at that time of year.  If you still want to try to find the cache during deer season you should wear blaze orange.

ATV use is not legal on the Shawnee National Forest.

This cache is in a camouflaged 11 cup (2.7 QT) Lock &amp; Lock container.  There is a first to find prize, a quart container and contents hidden with the cache.  Please do not take items from the FTF container, the prize is the container and all the contents.

The original contents of the cache are:
Pocket survival kit.
Can cozy.
Keychain light.
Set of carabiners.
Clip on light.
Waterproof matchbox.
Mini card game.
Carabiner compass.
Leave No Trace hangtag.
2 AA batteries.

Distance From Old: 104.7 feet
I&apos;m updating coordinates based on Orion&apos;s readings.  I was fairly certain the day that I planted the cache that the coords were probably a little off but I also felt like I was being watched.  This didn&apos;t concern me too much because 4HGal was in the car and she works here.  I will have her double check the corrected coords and will update again if necessary.  Thanks Orion and congrats on FTF.
Found it
2009-12-15 orion52, F#231@1210hrsCST. FTF. Corrected coordinates N37 42.988 W88 11.162. These coordinates were taken from two seperate GPS&apos;rs and should be quite accurate. Been trying for first to finds today but haven&apos;t been terribly successful at it until now. Even though you do not see any muggles around you can be fairly certain you are being watched any day that the Legion is open. While searching for this cache a elderly gentleman left the bar to ask us what we were doing, we explained, and he returned to the Legion. Shortly afterwards when I had located the cache he returned to ask if we had located what we were looking for and stated that a lady had been seen a few days earlier in the area we were looking in. Since I am the first to find the cache the lady had to be GRACIEDI, the owner. So if you want to be fairly certain you will have no one watching you will have to pick a time when the Legion is not open. TFTC.

DESC: We are having the fifth birthday party for River Valley Geocachers
January 16 from 1:00 p.m. to ?:00 p.m.
River Valley Geocachers were officially five years old December 5,
2009, but due to how busy everyone is around the holidays we will
have a belated birthday party. 
 
The party will be at GEO.JOE&apos;s family&apos;s homeplace. There will be
limited seating so bring a lawn chair, if you have a folding
table/card table that would be helpful as well. 
 
The event will begin with a meet and greet and socializing.
Hopefully there will be some event caches to hunt or GPS Games
before dark.
 
We will be having a chili supper around 5:00 p.m.
*Please post Will Attend logs early or there may not be any food
for you.*
I plan on cooking to accommodate the number that have made a &quot;Will
Attend&quot; log by Thursday 01-14-10.
GEO.JOE will bring chili (a no bean Chili Mac), however, anyone
that is proud of their chili is welcome to bring some and we can
have an unofficial chili cook off. If you do not like chili make
sure you bring something for yourself.
Desserts, snacks and finger foods are welcome as well. If you have
another dish that you are particularly proud of please bring it to
share.
Bowls, plates, spoons, napkins, crackers &amp;amp;  Frito&apos;s will be
provided so if there is anything else you like to eat with your
chili feel free to bring it and mention it in your log. 
Tea, coffee &amp;amp;  water will be provided but feel free to bring
whatever you like to drink. There will be no refrigerator space
available so please bring a cooler if you have anything that needs
to remain cold. There is a stove and oven if items need to be
warmed and plenty of counter space and plugins for crockpots.

 
Following supper there will be a White Elephant Gift
Exchange.
The game is also known as Yankee Swap, Dirty Santa, Grinch
Exchange, Rob Your Neighbor, Chinese Auction and Thieving Secret
Santa.
Check the following link if you are unfamiliar with the game:
(visit link)

To participate in the gift exchange bring a wrapped gift with a
value of at least $10, (each person who wishes to participate must
contribute a gift). 
Please make sure it is a gift that someone would want to receive!
There have been problems in the past with low value/no value gifts,
so lets avoid that ? If it is not something that you would be proud
of admitting that you are the one that brought the gift, then don?t
bring it ;  ). 

I hope there will be some evening entertainment from members with
musical talent, so if you sing and play feel free to bring along
your instruments.

DESC: This is a easy two stage multi that will take you a mile or so east
of Mayfield. So hit the first stage of this cache and the &quot;Like a
Flower...&quot; cache before you head to the caches east of
town.
This cache is setup to mimic a scene
from one of my favorite movies &quot;Shooter&quot;. If you have seen the
movie you will pick up on it quick. If not, then you need to check
it out! YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO SEE THE MOVIE TO FIND THE CACHE! It is
a straight forward multi. 



In the movie Bob Lee Swagger (Mark
Wahlberg) uses the gun below as his weapon of choice. 



The Chey Tac M-200 is no ordinary rifle.
As pictured below it is a full package, called the Chey Tac M-200
Intervention System. The package includes the M-200, scope, .408
rounds designed for this gun, a laser range finder, a ballistics
computer, and MORE! A ballistics computer you ask? Well the shooter
can feed all kinds of data into this Palm sized computer to allow
the system to be accurate BEOND 2 kilometers! With a few taps on
the screen the shooter can enter the wind speed where he is, the
estimated wind speeds at he target and between the shooter and the
target, the coord to his location on earth, the humidity, and more.
Then the computer will give the shooter the settings needed for the
scope to make the long shots. 



For the really long shots the ballistics
computer takes into consideration the curve of the Earth and even
the Rotation of the Earth. For instance if you are at the equator
and you target is directly west of you, the target is moving at
10,000 miles an hour at you if I remember correctly. So if your
target was east of your location the opposite would be true and
with 6 to 7 second flight times this will make a difference. Enough
about the system... 



To find the final container, an ammo
can, go to the first location. Find the first container and look to
see what letter of the alphabet is inside. Now starting with &quot;A&quot; as
1 count to see which number corresponds with the letter in the
first container. Now place two zeros after it to get something like
this .X00 then subtract that number from both the North and the
West part of these coordinates. N 36* 43.359 W 088* 37.011 to get
the coords for the final. I hope you like the cache as much as I
like the movie! ENJOY!!! 
P.S. If anyone would like to plunk down the $13,000 to $14,000 I
would be honored to accept it as a gift!Additional Waypoints

DESC: Looking for a small recycled flashlight. Bring your own pen.
Use caution when crossing the levee if the river is up. The road may be impassable then.  You are looking for a micro waterproof container that use to be a led flashlight. This road once lead to the ferry connecting Portageville, MO and Tiptonvillle, TN. The bridge was built across the Mississippi River at Caruthersville in the late 1970&apos;s. The only way across the river was by ferry boat before that.  There were ferries about every 30 miles or so up and down the river.  The only other way across the river was the bridges at Cairo, IL or Memphis, TN..
Hint: the end of the road.

Had to go do other caches and come back when fewer muggles were around.  And still had to fess up what we were doing.  But might have a new cacher out there, plus she has relatives in a MI town that I lived in for 22 years.

2009-11-04 terrillh60, Loved this cache!  I pulled into the parking area as close to the cache as I could.  Not in one of the reserved parking spots.  The bus stop was full of people, so I decided to use my phone to find this one.  I did the bluetooth ear piece act like I&apos;m talking while I walk.  This car pulls in right in front of me with this kid behind the wheel looking really scared.  Then clipboard lady gets out of the car, walks up to me and ask if I&apos;m here for a driving test.  I tell her &quot;no Ma’am.  I just waiting to meet a friend and I&apos;m not from around here.  She smiled and said very nicely that I may want to move my car, and that they use this area as a driving test during the week, and the kids get very nervous when they have to pull in near something.  So I very politely moved my car to the recommended location while she gave the poor boy’s mom the fail slip and hopped into another car and drove off with the next kid.  Giving me the perfect opportunity to grab the cache.  God Bless that poor women, not a job I would prefer to do.  TFTC!

Clever final. We all walked around it before I found it, walked away and told Cluso I had it. Nothing like a little confusion for fun. Watch for Poison Ivy in the area.

Illinois: Corn and...Waterfalls?
 If you&amp;nbsp;  have ever driven through Illinois, whether its from
Chicago to St. Louis on I-55 or east/west on I-80 or I-70, your
impression of Illinois will be that of corn, corn and more corn and
all of it flat land. Millions of years ago, glaciers flatten much
of the land that is now Illinois. However the glaciers did not
extend to the tip of southern Illinois. The far tip of southern
Illinois is considered an &quot;unglaciated&quot; area, or in other words,
not scoured flat by pre-historic glaciers. However, even though the
glaciers did not extend to the tip of Southern Illinois, the
powerful force of the water from the melting glaciers did affect
the area and helped carve canyons. The bedrock, consisting of
sandstone and limestone is the predominant geologic feature in this
area. Southern Illinois? fascinating geological features are the
products of millions of years of tectonic activity followed and
accompanied by thousands of years of deluge by melted glacial&amp;nbsp; 
waters. (http://shawnee.fws1.com/contact.html).
Today, the glacial waters have receded, but creeks fed from rain
run-off or natural springs has continued to fall through these
canyons, often creating waterfalls rivaled to those seen in the
mountains out west.


The Anatomy of a Waterfall
 
A waterfall begins as a stream or river. It does not take much
water to create a waterfall, only time and soft rock. As the water
continues to wear away the softer rock, valleys are formed and
canyons and cliffs are created. Canyons and cliffs may be made up
of different types of rock. A resistant layer, like bedrock, will
remain at the top of the cliff, and is called a caprock. The
caprock prevents the erosion at the top of the cliff but softer
layers, like sandstone, underneath the caprock will erode as the
water flows over the cliff,&amp;nbsp; forming a ledge.


&amp;nbsp; 
&amp;nbsp; 
As these layers are eroded away, the caprock is
left as an overhang until finally it cannot support itself and
falls as a large block. The water continues to erode more soft rock
and the process continues. For more information, visit &quot;Waterfalls
101: How are Waterfalls formed?&quot;:


http://www.world-of-waterfalls.com/featured-articles-waterfalls-101-how-are-waterfalls-formed.html
&amp;nbsp; 


&amp;nbsp; 



&amp;nbsp; 
Not all waterfalls fit neatly into one category. Some falls may
begin as a cascade and end as a plunge. The type of waterfall also
depends on how much water is falling. During a drought, with little
water flowing, a waterfall may be a trickle over a ledge, but after
heavy rain, could be a Block/Sheet or Cataract.
http://worldwaterfalls.com/waterfall_types.php
&amp;nbsp; 


Burden Falls Wilderness Area Located in the Shawnee
National Forest, south of Harrisburg IL is the Burden Falls
Wilderness Area, designated a Wilderness Area by the Illinois
Wilderness Act of 1990.&amp;nbsp; At the southern most tip of the
wilderness is Burden Falls. Burden Falls is formed by the Burden
Branch of the Saline River and is considered the highest waterfall
in Illinois.
(http://www.visitgolconda.com/node/277).
The stream falls in two sections. The upper falls is visible from
near the parking lot.&amp;nbsp; 
There are no designated trails in the Burden Falls Wilderness
Area. &amp;nbsp; There are some scramble routes up and down the side of
the falls that people do use.&amp;nbsp;  Use the path that leaves the
west side of the parking area. The path heads a few hundred yards
downstream before turning and dropping into the bottom of the
canyon. &amp;nbsp; From there walk up the stream to the bottom of the
Falls. &amp;nbsp; This route would be more readily accessible to people
who are not avid scramblers.&amp;nbsp;  This area is mildly rugged and
keep in mind that you might get wet. Terrain rating is about a 2-3.
Be careful if you have small kids (or adventurous teen-agers) with
you. Please note that there are no handrails or other safety
equipment around.&amp;nbsp;  Get a good view of the falls and answer the
questions below to log this earthcache.
If you are adventurous and in fairly good health, take the path
to the right to descend into the canyon below the falls. The
terrain difficulty here is at least a 4. Please do not try this
with young children or if you you are in poor health or poor
physical shape. Note that the trail runs out quickly and you will
have to climb over rocks and boulders to go down to the bottom.
Take extra care going in this area. I can&apos;t imagine what the cost
of an emergency rescue would be for this area
 if you do choose to make the journey
to the bottom, the view will be spectacular and worth the effort.
Remember, gravity can help you get down, but it makes it more
difficult to get back up.
This area is open only to foot traffic or equestrian use. No
other forms of transportation is allowed beyond the parking lot
such as mountain bikes nor any motorized vehicles. Please practice
&quot;Leave No Trace&quot; when visiting this beautiful area. Also, if you do
find some trash, please practice CITO. Let&apos;s leave this area as
beautiful as you found it.&amp;nbsp; 


To log this earthcache, email me the answers to
the folllowing.

The quantity of water at the falls may vary depending on the
season and recent or lack of rainfall. Based on the waterfall you
see, what type of waterfall would you classify this and why?
What is the layer of bedrock called at the top of the
falls?
Take a picture of yourself with your GPS with the waterfall in
the background and add it to your log entry. If you are not able to
go to the bottom of the lower falls, take a picture of yourself on
the path to the left or right with the falls in the background. If
you are not able to get a good picture of the falls from there,
stand on the caprock near where the water falls over the edge.
(Please be careful, this is supposed to be fun, not scary). If you
do not post of a picture of yourself with your GPS, I will delete
the log entry. No hand shots either, I&apos;d like to see your face and
your reaction to this area.

Thanks to Ranger Tim Pohlman from the
Shawnee National Forest for approving this
earthcache.


If you have enjoyed your visit to Burden Falls,
please tell your friends about it or better yet take them there. I
dragged my daughter there on Mother&apos;s Day and when she saw the
place, she didn&apos;t want to leave. As I stood at the bottom of the
falls and again as we walked through the canyon I had to keep
reminding myself that we were not in Colorodo or Wyoming, but in
Southern Illinois! Enjoy.
Direction to Burden Falls Wilderness
Area From the North: Take Interstate 57
south to IL-13 in Marion IL. (exit 54). Take IL-13 east about 23
miles to Harrisburg IL. Turn Right on Commercial St. (IL-34/US45).
Follow it about a mile and turn left on IL-145. Take IL-145 south
about 11 miles to Delwood IL. Turn right (west) on the gravel road
to Bell Smith Springs. Continue for 4.5 miles to the parking area
on the right for Burden Falls Wilderness. The water flowed over the
road just before the parking lot.
From the South: Take Interstate 24 north
to IL-146 (exit 16). Drive east on Illinois 146 for less than mile
to Illinois 147. Turn left onto Illinois 147, and drive 13 miles to
Illinois 145. Turn left onto Illinois 145, and drive 12 miles. Turn
left (west) on the gravel road to Bell Smith Springs. Continue for
4.5 miles to the parking area on the right for Burden Falls
Wilderness. The water flowed over the road just before the parking
lot.

How has this been up a month and no FTF yet?!?!

Wow, This is a great place for an Earthcache. My family and I have spent several wonderful afternoons hiking and exploring this area. Today was the first time we have seen a decent amount of water flowing over the falls though. We keep hoping to see it really going someday. The falls are also very cool looking in the winter with icecicles hanging from the top.

Thanks for this cache 2 cats!

The cache is placed in an area that promises to develop over the years.  The drive through the area is very tranquil. You should be able to drive to around 400 feet near the site. Short people should have a easy time finding this. If you are tall it will not be impossible to find just a bit harder. The cache was placed in a area so that one would bother it or get removed from other natural forces. You will be looking for a film canister with a new lid, a new log, and a prepared buffalo tube for the FTF. BYOP.  It is best to approach the cache from the east side.

This cache was created for one of our Grandsons known as Razor to the people he races his quad with.  He started racing when he was 8 years old and has been class champion for many of the years since then.  This year he will be 15 and is once again ?Class Champion?.  

This is one in a series of caches created for our grand children.  

When we went to the ?GEO Caching in the Park? event at Noble Park, he won a travel bug so we created a cache just for him. 

This cache is the starting point for the TB &quot;Quad Kid&quot; TBJXTW, Razor won, then named the TB. 

This Cache is placed with the permission and approval of the owner who was happy to suggest the placement himself.   He owns the Pit Stop Cafe which is a good place to eat.

 This cache is in a Lock &amp; Lock container and can be accessed from the pavement of the parking lot.
Thank you.

2009-12-09 myotis, OCW K-Team and N0WNV.  Talk about a cold day!!!  And the wind!!  What a day to be caching-we must be insane.  In the teens and 50 mph winds.  Did I mention how cold it was?  We headed down to Perryville and the Cape and had a great and cold time.  Lots of really nice caches.  But it was cold.  Thanks for all the great caches.

I also placed a geocoin that I found in paducah earlier in the summer. My plans were to take the coin out of state but due to being laid off I will not be planning any trips out of state. Enjoy.

2009-12-22 CyclonicKWF, My family decided to hit the nearby skating rink on a balmy 56 degree day in Paducah.  While they were skating I decided to take advantage of the situation and grab this cache.  I thought this would be an easy cache to find, but there are several people that come and watch the river roll by.  Or at least they are watching the river traffic.  When I arrived at the cache there was a tug and barges parked in the river right by where the cache was.  It was waiting for the area to clear out before it headed on.  There were a couple people parked in their vehicles.  I also saw some sort of official looking person walking around keeping on things.  Just when I thought the coast was clear a City of Paducah truck pulls up checking the lights.  I like how they worked.  They checked a light for a minute then talked to each other for about 30 minutes.  Very efficient use of their time.  In the mean time they were slowing my attempt at grabbing the cache.  Finally with the workers looking the other way and the vehicles cleared out I was able to grab the cache.  I moved to a nearby bench to sign the log.  Then I replaced the cache and headed on my way.  Thanks for the cache.

that has been wrapped in camo duct tape. The container is big
enough for small trade items. You can park along the street or
there is a small parking area close to the cache. Happy caching!!

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular

DESC: Ammo box near the bank of the Ohio River. Short hike on gravel road, security light for night hunting.
The location of this cache is Turner&apos;s Landing, named for Oscar Turner, an early settler of Ballard County.  On some maps, I have seen it called Olmsted Ferry Road. If you turn off Hwy 60 on Turner Landing Road, you will pass through Oscar, also named for him. To locals of a certain age, this particular stretch of riverbank is known as ?Knock &apos;Em Out? (use your imagination...). In the past, you could drive all the way to the riverbank, but there is now a gate where you can park for the short walk to the cache. The name of the cache comes from the view. Look across the river and you can see the new Olmsted Locks and Dam being constructed. There is a security light near the cache, so it shouldn&apos;t be too hard to find even at night.  After finding, please replace and conceal. Good luck and have fun!

DESC: Fun, Easy to find cache. Location of cache is on private property, however due to the nature of the cache, visitors are permitted on the premises during regular and non-business hours. We would like feedback on this educational cache, so please provide a brief comment on the log book and/or through the GeoCache website.

Hint: Near the picnic table on the side of the building with the handicap accessible entrance (Northwest side of the building)

DESC: This is my second in a series of Creek Caches.
The geocache is a small (1/4 size smaller than 35mm canister) clear container with log and nothing to write with BYOP!! Could possibly hold a geocoin but no more than one. The geocache is located within the Massac Park campground. Enjoy the view of the creek and surrounding area. Please keep an eye on kids/pets when arriving to ledge overlooking the creek. Geocache IS NOT NEAR THE LEDGE! 

Per Forest Service:
The following are required under IDNR guidelines:
1. Geocache is placed on department-managed property with permission of site superintendent; 
2. Do not place the following items in the geocache: food items, inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials.
3. It is the visitor?s responsibility to orient themselves with policies and rules pertaining to this department-managed site.
Hint: There are multiple ways to access this cache, below are my fave ways:
1. via the Massac Park gravel trails (only to get to the camp)
2. via a scenic trail running along side of the camp:

2009-11-07 GEO.JOE, Took us a while to find it. The coordinates were right on but we were just not looking there. We thought we were looking for something 1/4 the size of a film canister so we were not looking for something that big. Is that a good excuse. ;  ). We were checking nooks and knots and everywhere else we thought was devious enough. We decided to decrypt the hint but it just told us how to get to where we already were??? (That information should be in the description. Information to help find the cache after you are at the cache coordinates would be helpful in the hint or leave it blank if you don&apos;t want to give one.) We were determined so we kept looking. I was branching out and looking at places that I was sure it would not be and luckily Fairy Flirt went back to where the GPS said it should be and she spotted it. 
The ziploc was all torn up but the container was dry inside. 
The creek was way up today, it looked like a lake out there. Neat spot, thanks for sharing the location.

Paducah, 1832. Government is County Commission.
This can be a very busy area during the day. It might be better to
hit this cache at night. Either way, be stealthy. After you find
the cache, look for a pipe sticking out of the ground. In the pipe

DESC: The Shawnee Hills &quot;Wild Cache&quot; series goal is to get people out in the &quot;wild&quot; who like to hike and see unique areas of Southern Illinois.
This is the first in a series of caches in Southern Illinois.  This cache is located near the Wolfden Hollow Trail by Cedar Lake. The trail will take you very close to the cache location. No need to bushwack for long distances.

There are multiple waterfalls in the area, so take some extra time to explore.

I had previously hid a cache in this area, but was worried that there would be damage to the thin soil located on the rocks.  The current area is more able to handle geo-traffic.  

The May 8, 2009 wind event has drastically affected this area.  Trees have been blown down and uprooted.  The trail though has been cleared for foot use.  With saying this, please be aware of your surroundings, because there may be loose limbs above.

Here are some stats on Cedar Lake found on lakelubbers.com.

Cedar Lake is a 1,750 acre reservior created by the city of Carbondale for a municipal water supply.  Cedar Creek, a tributary of the Big Muddy river, was dammed in 1973-74 to create 30 miles of shoreline. The max depth is around 40 feet and the average depth is 14 feet.  

If you plan your trip after a recent rainstorm, you may see the waterfall flowing on your way to this cache.  Precaution must be taken in this area after a rain or snow, because the rocks can be extremely slippery.  There is one main creek crossing, but this shouldn&apos;t be to bad, just make sure you have shoes on that you don&apos;t mind getting wet.

Waypoints have been included for the trailhead, waterfall, and creek crossing.

Hope you enjoy and Happy Caching!

2009-10-17 maleki, Beautiful area with some hints of new fall color and a great walk, what more can one ask for.  Great cache!!!  We initially found another cache and head along the trail at that level before encountering private property signs before doubling back and finding a nice rocky chute that brought us down to the right level.  That was fun.  Missed a turn for this trail and once again approached some no tresspassing signs.  Found the trail again only a couple hundred feet back.  Enjoyed the rocks and the great walk and having the place ALL to ourselves.  We have been on the road for three rainy days so this AM it was nice to occasionally have a few teases of blue sky and sun.  TFTC!  These great caches make us want to come back to the area soon.  Talking about trying again in a couple weeks.

DESC: The Shawnee Hills &quot;Wild Cache&quot; series goal is to get people out in the &quot;wild&quot; who like to hike and see unique areas of Southern Illinois.
This is the second in a series of caches in Southern Illinois. This cache is located on part of the River to River trail by Cedar Lake. The trail will take you very close to the cache location. No need to bushwack for long distances.  

This distance from the described parking area is about 1.5 miles, making this a 3 mile overall hike.  Its about .2 mile from the cache to the spillway, well worth the extra mileage.

The May 8, 2009 wind event has drastically affected this area. Trees have been blown down and uprooted. The trail though has been cleared for bike and foot use. With saying this, please be aware of your surroundings, because there may be loose limbs above.

Although the trail should be easy to follow make sure to print off a topo map just in case you should become disoriented.  There area several side trails that could be misleading.  Make sure to use your GPSr to mark your car and intersections just in case.

Please be aware this is prime hunting area, so check the Illinois department of natural resources site for hunting season.  Absolutey, avoid this area during deer shotgun season.

There are at least 4 trailhead areas for this cache, but only three can be reached by an average car.  The parking area I will describe is the closest, but the least known.

The parking area is located at the end of Little Cedar Rd.  There is a gate there and off to the right and left are entrances to private orchards.  Absolutely do not park in front of any of the side roads leading to the orchards or vineyards.These areas are all Private Propery. There is enough room on both sides to get completely off the road. The blocked road is part of the Shawnee National Forest.

The trail is on the other side of the dead end gate.  The trail is an old road that may be overgrown, so bring bug spray or long pants for the first portion in the summer.  Descend down and continue stratight until the first Y.  I have made a waypoint for this turn (see below YTRAIL).  Continue on until you come to the intersection with the River to River Trail and turn left (see waypoint below RTRT).  Follow the River to River trail to the cache.

The lake you will see on your left is Little Cedar Lake.  This is the municipal water supply for Alto Pass.  After locating the cache make sure to continue down the trail to the natural spillway betwen Little Cedar Lake and Cedar Lake.  If it has rained recently be careful the current can be swift.  I&apos;ve seen huge carp get caught in the pools during high water.  If the water is low, take time to eat a lunch or soak your toes.

DESC: The Shawnee Hills &quot;Wild Cache&quot; series goal is to get people out in the &quot;wild&quot; who like to hike and see unique areas of Southern Illinois.
This cache is a sibling of  &quot;Shawnee Hills Wild Cache 3: Little Cedar Spillway&quot; (GC1X8A7).  Since the parking area might be hard for some to find, the thought was to put a cache near the dead end gate of Little Cedar Rd. 

This is a micro cache and just here to help, but it is an extra smiley on the stats.  For some that are not capable of completing the Little Cedar Spillway cache this cache may take you to a trailhead that you may not know existed.

This gate was not always here.  At one time you could park on top of the hill just past the River to River intersection, but several years ago an incident occured with a group of people that came to this area to party.  The group ended up having a dispute with the game wardens and they flattened there tires.  They, also, killed a calf that was owned by a local.

This gate was put up by the county to discourage activity like this in the future.  It has seemed to have worked.  The area has now become more of a &quot;wilderness&quot; area, but the area is still active and used by hikers, horse riders, mountain bikers, hunters, and people fishing.

Enjoy and Happy Caching!

2009-11-07 GEO.JOE, We got to the cache site as it was getting dark so we knew we were not going to make it to Wild cache 3 but thought we would grab this one while we were close. We had just started hunting real good when Fairy Flirt warned me to watch out for dog poo. I should have listened - That&apos;s right as I was looking for a cache and not where my feet where so I spent what was left of the daylight scraping my shoe and splashing it in a mud puddle : (. 
At least we know where to park when we make it back up here for the wild caches.

The Shawnee Hills &quot;Wild Cache&quot; series goal is to get people out in the &quot;wild&quot; who like to hike and see unique areas of Southern Illinois.

This cache is located near the Wolfden Hollow Trail by Cedar Lake. The trail will take you very close to the cache location. No need to bushwack for long distances. 

The total distance to the cache is about 1.8 miles, making it a round trip of 3.6 miles.  Make sure to take time to find the other caches in this area.

Much of the description for parking and other waypoints is left up to the origanl cache in this series, so please reference the Shawnee Hills &quot;Wild Cache&quot; 1: Beaver Tree (GC1WX6Z).

The cache name is reflected on the .7 mile trip from GC1WX6Z to this cache.  The total distance from the 1st cache and back is 1.4 miles.  It is well worth the extra effort in the views and cool sandstone bluffs that you will encounter on your way there.  I found a couple of cool slots in the sandstone and a great wide-angle view of the lake.

Enjoy &amp; Happy Caching

This cache is not meant to be tricky.  Please make sure to recover the cache exactly as found.


Hope you enjoy and Happy Caching!

DESC: The Shawnee Hills &quot;Wild Cache&quot; series goal is to get people out in the &quot;wild&quot; who like to hike and see unique areas of Southern Illinois.
This is the third in a series of caches in Southern Illinois. This cache is located on the River to River trail by Cedar Lake. The trail will take you very close to the cache location. No need to bushwack for long distances.

This distance from the described parking area is about 1.14 miles, making this a 2.28 mile overall hike. There are two major creek crossing, so take caution after recent rainstorms.

The May 8, 2009 wind event has not affected this area as much as around Cove Hollow and the Spillway.  The trail though has been cleared.  With saying this, please be aware of your surroundings, because there may be loose limbs above.

Although the trail should be easy to follow make sure to print off a topo map just in case you should become disoriented. Make sure to use your GPSr to mark your car and intersections just in case.

Please be aware this is prime hunting area, so check the Illinois department of natural resources site for hunting season. Absolutey, avoid this area during deer shotgun season.

The trailhead for this cache is just off old HWY 51.  Turn on W McGuire Rd and then turn left onto Rowan RD.  Follow Rowan straight until a side road goes to Rowan Cemetery.  The trailhead parking (waypoint PARK) is on the right.

I had not hiked this trail in years and was glad to be back.  I had forgotten how nice a trail and the area is on this side of the lake.  The trail is well maintained, but the first part underneath the powerlines looked like it could get dense, but the area had recently been mowed when we visited.  While we descended to the Clay Lick Creek we catch glimpses of Cedar Lake off to the right. 

Continue up and and around to Mill Creek, about 1.14 miles from the trailhead.  This creek is filled with rocks of all sizes.  I will have to explore this creek further upstream in the fall to find out where all these rocks have come from.

Save some energy for going back, because most of it is going uphill.  Enjoy &amp; Happy Caching.

day while we was out driving around on a very nice day. There is
some very interesting headstones here made out of all kinds of
things. Be sure to check out the Tree right next to Parking coords
&amp;amp;  see if you can see the Faces &amp;amp;  Heads on it &amp;amp;  How many
do you see?? Wildest looking tree we ever saw. 
To start your little walk from the Parking coords listed below,
Go to the posted coords listed above &amp;amp;  your looking for a
unusual headstone (one of a kind for sure)
Find the year this person was born
Now subtract the year from 27930 (27930 - Year = ABCDE)
Place the numbers where they belong below
N37 41.ABA
W088 00.CDE
Now add these coords to your GPSr &amp;amp;  follow to where they
lead you
When you get in this next area. You will be looking for a very
young man. As for his age, He had to have hold a special place in
someones,,
Find his birthdate &amp;amp;  do some adding
Now add the Year to 249152 (249152 + Year = ECBACD)
Now place the numbers where they belong below
N37 41.ECB
W088 01.ACD
Now if you did all this right, You should find the Final
Stage.
There is a FTF Gift for the FTF
There are some trade items. So if you take
something, PLEASE!! Leave something or just don&apos;t take nothing at
all.There is No Pen or Pencil in the Final, So PLEASE BYOP!! &amp;amp;

2009-09-21 ReedKyCacheFinders, We was south of here today doing some house hunting &amp; figured we would drop by &amp; check out the Math on this puzzle cache. We have 3 GPSr&apos;s now &amp; the Math &amp; Coords will remain as is. The 2nd stage coords after doing the Math took us within a few feet from the stone to get the date to figure out the final stage. Doing the math &amp; putting in the coords got us within less than 9 feet of the Final stage. Funny thing while we was headed to check on this cache is the same 2 people that was mowing their yards the day we hid this cache was mowing their yards today. Not same yards either, about 1/4 mile apart. Plus the tree near the parking coords looked like it had changed too??
Found it
2009-09-06 racer2814, FTF. This one took way too long and I think I saw every inch of the cemetery. At the 2nd stop I had the wrong &quot;Young&quot; man which produced a fruitless search and I just started checking every likely spot within a couple hundred feet. I went back to the Jeep to make sure I had the correct number to add and then checked the stone again and decided to try the other &quot;young&quot; man. Was better but coords sent me 45ft past the cache and found it on the way back out. Orale! Live, laugh, love, cache.

Didn&apos;t find it
2009-11-28 deercreekth, Well tanks for bringing me here, but I couldn&apos;t find it.  When I saw there was a tank cache in Uniontown, I was expecting it to be downtown for some reason.  I can&apos;t remember a tank being right here.  When I was a teenager, we&apos;d sometimes drive up a nearby hill and come flying down the other side.  Other than that, I didn&apos;t really spend much time in this area of town.

I came prepared in old clothes hoping for the FTF.  When I approached, I immediately went underneath it.  I didn&apos;t see any wasps today, but there was glass from broken beer bottles underneath it.  I didn&apos;t see anything promising underneath, so I checked all over the sides.  My GPSr had me going to one side, then changed it mind to the other, and then back.  I never did climb on top, although I considered it.  I even gave up, went to look for another cache, and then came back to give this some more looks.  So many great possible spots, but I never could find it.  I may be back.

2009-11-28 deercreekth, This is only the second time I&apos;ve ever been in this cemetery.  The first time I was here for my Aunt&apos;s funeral.  When I got out of the car, I figured I knew where this was going to have to be.  Yep, it was there, and the coordinates were nearly perfect.  The cache is actually pretty close to my Aunt&apos;s grave, so I was able to visit.  Thanks for placing this cache here.

Probably will bring a machete and bug spray next time.  Also the gps went goofy and accuracy went from 12 feet to 64 feet, I guess the geogods were not smiling on me tonight, just laughing.....

Very nice cache though and I hope this one has longevity!

This is one in a series of caches created for our grand children.  
 This cache was created for one of our Grand daughters who loves Tinkerbell hence the name.  She is of the firm belief that fairies live in the LBL as I believe also.  Just look around at all the little people and watch the magic of their laughter.  This grand daughter is also a ?Fancy Dancer? at pow wows.    Fancy Dancers resemble butterflies in their bright colored and fringed regalia.

2009-12-21 CyclonicKWF, The month and year are winding down and in need of a cache for December I took sometime from my Holiday break to grab some caches. Since we had been visiting my wife&apos;s family in Calvert City I figured this would be a great time to hit some of the caches in Northern Land Between the Lakes.

I figured I should pick up the caches here before heading to the Northern Welcome Station area.  After debating on the best way to approach the other nearby cache I decided instead to grab this cache, Tink, which was in the campground area and then see if I could find a better trail map for the other cache.  I found it without any problems.  I can imagine in the summer and other busy times that cachers will have to be very careful with Muggles when retrieving this cache.  However, today I did not have any problems.  I do not know why more people do not take advantage of the area in 32 degree weather.  [:)]

After signing the log, I replaced the cache and headed on my way.  Thanks for the cache.

 The Great American GPS Stash Hunt !!
 -- 

 Now that SA is off we can start a worldwide Stash Game!!
With
Non-SA accuracy it should be easy to find a stash from
waypoint
information. Waypoints of secret stashes could be shared on the

Internet, people could navigate to the stashes and get some
stuff. The only rule for stashes is: Get some Stuff, Leave
some
Stuff!! The more valuable the stuff the more stashes will be
started. 

 I&apos;m thinking of half burying a five gallon plastic bucket with

lid at the stash point. Putting in some stuff. Adding a logbook

and pencil so visitors can record their find. The log should 
contain: Date, Time, What you got, and What you put in. Scanning

the log book should give you a quick inventory of the stash. 

 I&apos;ll look for a place near a road where few people would 
normally go... Put in some cash, an old digital camera, and some

antique silverware!! I will come up with a cool name for my 
stash and post coordinates soon!!! 

 Make your own stash in a unique location, put in some stuff and

a log book. Post the location on the Internet. Soon we will have

thousands of stashes all over the world to go searching for. 
Have Fun!!

 Lots of goodies for the finders. Look for a black plastic

About the tribute cache...
&amp;nbsp; 
So one day I get this idea to place a tribute cache to the
&quot;Original Stash&quot;. The next thing I know I have taken it over board!
I think that my taking it over board will make it one of your
favorite caches. I can not get to the &quot;Original Stash Plaque&quot; any
time soon but some day. Because of this cache you will be able to
experience both the &quot;Original Stash&quot; and the &quot;Original Stash
Plaque&quot;. Well at least as good as it will get here in KY. I have
put together a bucket with all of the original swag.
***IMPORTANT*** the log book is in the
&quot;Can of Beans&quot; just pull up on the top!
PLEASE keep all trade items and travelers
in the plastic container in the bucket.
REMEMBER do not take any of the original
swag.

 This cache is placed with my permission. Just park in the gravel
driveway less than 50 feet from the cache. BRING A CAMERA!

 REMEMBER: It is better to give than receive! Give back to the
sport by placing caches. If you hide it, they will come!

2009-09-04 CyclonicKWF, After teaching today, I thought I would take advantage of what started out as a beautiful day to do some caching.  Since Regnad was busy with meetings I decided to go to Mayfield seeing how it is so close and there were several caches there I needed to find.  

I figured I would make one last stop before heading into Mayfield.  This was an easy find, though the rain dampened the hunt.  Someone even came out of the house briefly.  Glad to know they approve of the cache ; ).   I did not read that the logbook was in the can of beans, so I searched for a few minutes trying to figure out where the log was.  That&apos;s what I get for not fully reading the cache page.  I signed the log.  I did not swap anything.   I replaced the cache and headed on my way.

2009-09-12 Hunts with Wine, This one took awhile.  It wasn&apos;t where our GPS took us.  It wasn&apos;t where we, as other hiders would have put it either.  Just a simple hide none-the-less that was pretty well hidden.  You find it and then think, &quot;now why did that take me so long?&quot;
Didn&apos;t find it
2009-09-05 kbwolfe, Another one not found. Enjoyed the search and the weather was being to threaten. #1 son practiced his ghostly sessions, #2 son played on the nearby playground, and I searched for and did not find a cache. I found where it could be, but not where it is. (or it&apos;s gone) We did notice that this place is full of Crooks. TFTH.

SIZE: Regular
D3.0/T3.0
DESC: This is a tribute to the original cache by Myotis.
 IMPORTANT NOTE: This hunt will take you near 250 foot bluffs. Make sure you pay attention to the directions!
Follow the trail at the parking area to Inspiration Point, you will see where it gets its name from. It has an awesome panoramic view-It is one of the best views in Illinois. You can see the bluffs, LaRue Swamp below, Big Muddy River, and the Mississippi in the distance. This area is part of LaRue Pine Hills which is the most biologically diverse (i.e., number of species of plants and animals) area in North America outside of the tropics.

Inspiration Point is a small point (palisade) with a 250 foot sheer cliff on three sides. There are no protective fences. There is a trail to it and people go out on it all the time as it has one of the best views in Illinois. I would leave small children on the trail. You will be coming down the trail and there is a tree fallen across the trail and then you will see a trail to the point on the bluff. There is nothing you need to get here besides inspired.

After checking out the view follow the trail to N37 35.223 W89 26.356. There is a big sign here. The final is at: N37 35.34A W89 26.29B

A = The number of letters in the first word (top row). Minus 1 

B = The number words with only two letters. 

NOTE: At this point there is a path that goes up on top. If you go the short distance up to the top, at N37 35.244 W89 26.377, there is a nice view. If you wimped out on Inspiration point, this one is not as scary. So if you are afraid of heights, this may be the view for you.

Cache ID: GC1YNAB
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T3.0
DESC: This is a tribute to Hutchins Creek Cache originally placed by Myotis. 

Your looking for a large sized lock n lock container painted to match the surroundings. It contains a log book, pen and some small trade items.
You may get your feet wet crossing the creek depending what time of the year it is(after the spring rains have gone you should be ok) Once your across its just a small climb into the woods at a ditch that drains into creek. Follow the ridge right to it or go to a level entrance area a little farther down and climb hill when you get close to cache, The hill climb is easy and can be done standing.

Give your GPSr time to settle down there is lots of tree cover, That&apos;s why I&apos;m trying to be so descriptive.

There is a small parking spot big enough for 2 or 3 cars, Once parked there is a small trail to the left which gets you to the creek.

This is not the intended path that Myotis had originally setup but it makes it quick, Later after I have hiked the trail I will add those elements also.  

Information about the area:
Although Clear Springs Wilderness and Bald Knob Wilderness are considered two separate areas, geographically they are one area. Separated only by Hutchins Creek, they are located in the Illinois Ozark natural division. Immediately to the south and west lies Camp Hutchins Proposed Wilderness Area (2967 acres) together the three areas comprise over 13,000 wilderness acres. Hutchins Creek (eligible for designation as a Wild &amp; Scenic River) has formed a wide, flat valley bordered by steep forested slopes, rocky bluffs, and V-shaped creek drainages. This area is relatively undisturbed by humans, with a couple of old farmsteads and cemeteries the only evidence of past human usage of the land. The mixed mesophytic forest and the clean, spring fed creeks, typical of the Ozarks, provides habitat for wildlife including neo-tropical songbirds, wild turkey, deer, bobcat, and many smaller mammals.

2009-10-17 maleki, First of the day.  The road in from the south was an adventure in itself in our little car.  A few  water crossings.  At least one that I took a big chance on.  Found suggested parking area and only got feet a bit wet at the crossing.  C went barefoot in the chilly water.  Nicely placed.  I have been sorry that I was unable to get to the original Myotis caches when briefly in the area in the past.  They have always been on the radar though.  These areas beat the now majority of cache hides, parking lots, street corners, etc, etc.  Thanks for keeping some real caching alive, too few nowadays.  Nicely placed.  We enjoyed the area a lot along with the first hints of fall colors.  We had intended to head to the Godwin Trail caches from here, just to the north a few miles, but the creek had taken out more of the road then our Pontiac Vibe could handle just a short distance to the north of this one so we sadly had to double back.  I driver went by and likely thru in a four wheel drive pickup as we were getting out to do this one.  We could see the fresh tracks on the other side of the wash.  Not us though.  TFTC!

 <desc>Rocky Top by GEO.JOE
Cache ID: GC1XG55
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T3.0
DESC: The views are amazing from Rocky Top!
Rocky Top is a high bluff with spectacular views North, East and
South. These are some of the best views I have seen in southern IL.
Rocky Top is a relatively easy 3/4 mile hike from One Horse Gap
along the River to River trail (marked with a blue i - trail 001).
The R2R trail will take you past the base of some really pretty
rounded sandstone bluffs, shelter caves and boulders before
reaching the surprising views from Rocky Top. 
I have the cache hidden on a rock outcropping just past a great
outlook with terraced rocks that make a great place to sit and
enjoy the vista (Warning: we did see a rattlesnake under the seat
when we were there last so take a look under rocks before sitting
down!). There is a tree near the cache that really stood out to me.
It has a large low limb that reminds me of a Live Oak. 
After finding the cache, if you want an adventure - the crack
heading south between the cache and the main bluff will lead to the
base of the bluff. I will call it One Joe Gap, because there was a
spot where it was so tight that, even after exhaling completely,
the rock walls were still rubbing my front and back. I really
enjoyed the crack because just as I thought I was not going to go
much farther, I shimmied down or slid through and made it all the
way to the base of the bluff. There was no trail at the base so
your options are to just head back up the crack, bushwhack to
explore the base of the bluff or head north around the rock
outcropping to find a little easier way back to the top. Trail
heads are the same as they are for One Horse Gap - you will go past
One Horse Gap on the way to Rocky Top. Here is a
SNF trail map to help. For
   the best road for any car: The One Horse Gap 106A west trailhead
   from Forest Service Road 186 - N37 31.261 W88 27.772: No parking
   spot, you just have to pull off the road. The hike is downhill
   to the top of One Horse Gap. One Horse Gap east 106A/Harts
   Hollow 178 trailhead is at N37 30.907 W88 27.162 ? The road can
   be rough the last .6 mile (I suggest a high clearance vehicle).
   The road is minimally maintained with big holes &amp;amp;  washes so
   after a rain it would be sloppy (possibly needing 4WD). The
   benefit of this trail is that it is downhill for 1/3 mile back
   to your vehicle from One Horse Gap or you could make a loop by
   using trail 177 to trail 178 back to your vehicle.Additional WaypointsET1XG55 - East TrailheadN 37° 30.907 W 088° 27.162East Trailhead, access road is rough last .6 mile.WT1XG55 - West TrailheadN 37° 31.261 W 088° 27.772West Trailhead from Forest Service Road 186. No designated parking.

2009-11-09 photohiker13, You finally got me GeoJoe.  I didn&apos;t know this place existed.  This is what geocaching is all about.  I doubt I would have ever found this place.  The vista was nice and one of the better views of the beloved Shawnee National Forest.  I checked out &quot;Joes Gap&quot;, which was narrow enough for a skinny guy with a backpack to have to push his way threw.  What a great crack in the rock.  Don&apos;t know of many that take one down to the bottom without a step drop off.  Explored the base of the bluff and discovered a &quot;cascade waterfall&quot; and an interesting shelter.  Thanks for bringing me here on a warm November day.  Keep up the great &quot;Wild Caches&quot;.  B.T.W. no rattlers today.

2009-09-13 adventuretrekker, Found this cache among other things while visiting the area with the River Valley Geocachers during our weekend campout. We decided to take the hike to Rocky Top from One Horse Gap. What a great little hike. Once at Rocky Top, we enjoyed the great view then it was off to find the cache. Found the cache pretty easy with Aimapper and 6lindseys. We debated exploring the bluff below but decided we were too sore and it was getting late so we decided to go on our way but not too soon. GEO.JOE surprised us all with his discovery, of a timber rattler. Glad I wasn&apos;t the first to find it. Luckily it wasn&apos;t too close to the cache but beware. Got lots of great pics and finally decided it was time to leave and then right there in the middle of the trail....what do you know, another rattlesnake. What is the chances of that? It was sure a beautiful snake as long as he didn&apos;t bother us. Took more pics and finally on our way again. Found a baby hog nose snake on the way back to the vehicles too. What a great trip!!!!! Thanks so much for this adventure.

2009-09-13 6Lindseys, I came up from Bowling Green KY to participate in the River Valley Geocachers Fall Campout.  I am so glad that I did!!  I had the BEST weekend.  Camping with friends, hiking and climbing on the rocks, and all the gorgous views both on the trail and at the overlooks.  

The morning was spent kayaking on Lake Glendale and getting ready for our hike to One Horse Gap and Rocky Top.  After exploring One Horse Gap and finding the cache there, we set out for this one at Rocky Top.

This was the last cache that I found while in the area.  What an experience it was too!!  This find was with the cache owner and Fairy Flirt as our guides to the sights.  Adventuretrekker and Airmapper and I were all trying to find the cache before each other.  It was fun trying to climb over the rocks and beat each other to the cache!

As with all of the other caches I had found, this one included a nice hike with awesome views and fun with friends.  On the way to the cache, we saw a deer.  On the way back was another experience entirely!  I had never seen a rattlesnake in the wild.  I saw one soon after returning the cache to its hiding spot!  He let us know he was there, then seemed to pose for pictures.  After settling down from that, we encountered another across the path on the way back!  He moved out of the way and let us pass without incident.  Then later on the trail, we saw a hog nosed snake who we didn&apos;t have to be so wary of as we were admiring him.  He was tiny and quite beautiful and didn&apos;t seem to mind our attention.  On we went toward our vehicles without any more snake encounters.  

I was late getting back to the campsite, and seeing the pictures from my adventures helped me plead my case with my husband.  LOL!

Thank you so much Geo.Joe and Fairy Flirt for placing this cache and for hosting such a fabulous weekend!  I&apos;m ready to go back and see more!

2009-09-13 GEO.JOE, We visited this cache during the River Valley Geocachers Fall Campout, so there will be found logs and and signatures that predate the publication date. So the FTF after publication is still up for Grabs. 

I do want to give a bit of a warning. We encountered 2 rattlesnakes while at the bluff. In 20 years of hiking in Shawnee National Forest I have only encountered 4 rattlesnakes (three all with in the last week) so to see two rattle snakes within 100 yards could just be good timing on our part or it may indicated a higher concentration of rattlesnakes in this area so do be careful. 

One snake was across the trail as we were leaving and it was easy to see but the first was actually under the ledge that I suggested as a seat to enjoy the view. You can imagine my surprise as I stepped off the rock to have a seat when I heard the rattle! My feet reacted faster than my brain could process what was happening. Before I knew was was going on I had hopped back on top of the rock and then my brain processed what the pattern was that I had seen 2 feet from where I stepped down [:O] so then I stepped down 3 feet from it to get a better look and a couple pictures ( I guess he enjoys that view as well).  So before you have a seat take a look under where you sit down and don&apos;t stick you hands where you have not looked.

DESC: One Horse Gap is a passage in the bluff that a person can ride a
horse through to get from the bottom of the bluff to the top of the
Bluff.
But there is so much more to see! The area has very unique, low,
rounded, lichen covered sandstone bluffs to explore. Trees on the
bluffs have more lichen on them than I have seen anywhere else.
Above One Horse Gap there is the beginning of a slickrock canyon
leading to a slickrock cascade/waterfall (when water is flowing ; 
), a deep valley to explore, bluff top trails going north and south
and a bluff base trail heading north toward the spectacular views
of Rocky Top .8 miles away. 
The cache is located on top of a rounded rock outcropping so you
will have to get to the top to find the cache. Depending on your
skill level there are many access points so just walk around until
you find a spot you are comfortable with (there are spots that my
6-year-old nephew can get to the cache). 

There are a couple trail heads to get to One Horse Gap
Here is a SNF trail map to
   help.
 
For the best road for any car: The One Horse Gap 106A west trail
head from Forest Service Road 186 - N37 31.261 W88 27.772: No

After finding this cache, we climbed a waterfall that was not flowing. It was an adventure and held more beautiful sights for us.

I just really like this area. The rounded rocks are so interesting to me, there are cracks and passages to explore and I always seem to find something new. We found a crack from the west side that we were able to work our way to top, that was lots of fun. We also had a chance to climb the waterfall since there was no water flowing.

DESC: A nice arch just off the road leading to Garden of the
Gods.
This is a cache in a series I am going to call The Bridges of
Saline Co. highlighting some of the natural bridges around Garden
of the Gods. 

The arch is very easy to get to and not even difficult to see.
However, I have passed it hundreds of times and I never knew it
existed. I often wondered what that little pull off with the rail
fence was for next to the road leading into Garden of the Gods.
Well I have now learned that if there is a parking area, there is
likely a reason ;  ) 

This is my kind of Park-n-Grab! The cache is less than 100 feet
from where you park. After finding the cache, cross the road and
follow the well used trail to the arch. I have not explored the
area around the arch so I do not know if there is a way to the top
of the arch, but there does look to be plenty of rocks and an
interesting bluff to explore. If it is like the rest of Garden of
the Gods, you will not be disappointed if you take some time to
explore a little.

 I have never seen this type of formation before. There are two
shelter caves with one above the other. Shelter caves are typically
at the base of the bluff where water has washed away softer
material. It is not uncommon to see a cave halfway up a bluff but
to see one halfway up the bluff and above another is quite unique.


This is just one of the interesting rock formations to experience
along the Indian Point trail. Here is a
SNF Trail Map Begin the 2
   mile lolly pop loop trail at the Backpacker&apos;s parking lot (N37
   36.005 W88 22.871) off the main road of Garden of the Gods. Keep
   in mind this cache is accessed from below the bluff. There may
   or may not be a way to get below the bluff near the cache so a
   straight line from the parking lot may not get you to the cache.
   Follow the Indian Point Trail out of the back of the parking
   lot. The trail is blazed with blue markers on trees. Be sure to
   check out the outlook at Indian Point (N37 35.543 W88 23.048).
   From there follow the trail east to get below the bluff and to
   the area of the cache. After finding the cache continue east to
   explore the other rock formations, cracks, passageways, a huge
   balanced rock, a natural bridge, caves and another outlook on
   top of the bluff near (N37 35.697 W88 22.685).

2009-10-12 Dr Pantz, Wow, was this cool.  All 4 of the kids climbed up to the top cave, and I admitted that I was a little too scared to do it myself, as the best route for me seemed to be just one bad footing away from disaster.  This was the 1st of 2 caches along this trail that we found, and the 9 year old found it first.  We left a geocoin we&apos;ve been holding for a while.

2009-12-20 gattmolson, Didn&apos;t find this one but its probably my fault.  We didn&apos;t have the hint or the time to keep looking.  I need to emphasize caution when crawling around the fallen rocks, I stepped right into a 2 foot hole filled to the top with leaves but luckily just scratched my shin.  Made for another awesome walk in the Shawnee that I&apos;d never done.

2009-10-12 Dr Pantz, Great cache at a great formation in a great park.  It was a beautiful day to hike in the Shawnee National Forest on the last day of our visit.  The kids loved playing around in and around the caves and rocks in the park.  I was glad to find two geocoins in the cache, as I&apos;ve seen a lot of caches lately missing tradables that are supposed to be in there.  We just took one, and left another.  I was also glad that this is a regular size, as a small or a micro would be really challenging in this area.  So many good hiding places.  Thanks for bringing us to this area.

 <desc>Metropolis Lake - A Natural Lake by Tor Bopp
Cache ID: GC1YF4V

SIZE: Not chosen
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: 
METROPOLIS LAKE
A Natural Lake

A natural lake is a body of water lying in depressed ground without direct connection with the sea. Lakes are common in formerly glaciated regions, along the courses of slow rivers, and in low land near the sea. The main classifications are by origin: glacial lakes, formed by glacial scouring;  barrier lakes, formed by landslides and glacial moraines;  crater lakes, found in volcanoes;  and tectonic lakes, occurring in natural fissures.
Crater lakes form in the calderas of extinct volcanoes, for example Crater Lake, Oregon. Subsidence of the roofs of limestone caves in karst landscape exposes the subterranean stream network and provides a cavity in which a lake can develop. Tectonic lakes form during tectonic movement, as when a rift valley is formed. Lake Tanganyika was created in conjunction with the East African Great Rift Valley. Glaciers produce several distinct types of lake, such as the lochs of Scotland and the Great Lakes of North America.
Lakes are mainly freshwater, but salt and bitter lakes are found in areas of low annual rainfall and little surface run-off, so that the rate of evaporation exceeds the rate of inflow, allowing mineral salts to accumulate. The Dead Sea has a salinity of about 250 parts per 1,000 and the Great Salt Lake in Utah has about 220 parts per 1,000. Salinity can also be caused by volcanic gases or fluids, for example Lake Natron, Tanzania.
In the 20th century large artificial lakes were created in connection with hydroelectric and other works. Some lakes have become polluted as a result of human activity. Sometimes eutrophication (a state of over nourishment) occurs, when agricultural fertilizers leaching into lakes cause an explosion of aquatic life, which then depletes the lake&apos;s oxygen supply until it is no longer able to support life.
Metropolis Lake Nature Preserve in western McCracken County, Kentucky is one of the most popular preserves in the nature preserve system. Named for the 50-acre natural lake on the Ohio River floodplain, the preserve provides 123 acres of important habitat for rare species and recreational opportunities. The land and 48 acres of the lake were purchased in 1984 by the Commission with the help of The Nature Conservancy. TVA owns the westernmost two acres of Metropolis Lake and the adjacent land.  TVA has agreed to help protect the natural integrity of the lake. Since 1984, the Commission has worked with local citizens to maintain the delicate balance between rare species protection and recreation use.  Metropolis Lake is one of the few remaining naturally formed bodies of water in the state that has not been developed.  Metropolis Lake is spring fed and benefits from the flood waters of the Ohio River.  At Metropolis Lake the noise from crowds of people have been replaced by the calls of kingfishers echoing across the water as the birds fly from tree to tree. The bald cypress and swamp tupelo trees that have encircled the spring-fed lake for hundreds of years stand as sentinels in the still waters.  Ouachita map turtles and red-eared sliders can be seen basking on fallen logs.  A short trail will take you through the preserve&apos;s uplands and along the lakeshore eventually bringing you back to the parking lot.  The underlying geology here consists of quaternary alluvium but the higher bluffs and slopes also contain wind-blown silt and clay called loess.  The basin lies parallel to the Ohio River and in flood conditions the water level of the lake can reach the base of the bluffs which covers the parking area with as much as ten feet or more of flood water.  Due to the long history of use by local citizens fishing remains an authorized activity.  However, hunting, camping, picnicking and trapping are not permitted in the preserve.  In addition, the preserve closes at dusk.

 

Qualifying log entries must include a picture of you holding your GPSr with the lake or the large cypress trees in the background.  To demonstrate the educational value of the EartheCache, you must email me the answers to the following questions:  1.  Standing in the parking area facing the boat ramp and lake, what man made item is visable to the left and within 100 feet of your position?  2.  What river lies parallel to Metropolis Lake?  3.  What two sources provide Metropolis Lake with its water?  4.  What does the underlying geology consist of at the Metropolis Lake Nature Preserve?

Over the years we made many trips to places like Pall Mall, TN, to the home of Alvin York, most decorated US soldier of WWI, Stones River Battlefield, the Bell Witch Cave, Andersonville, Chickamauga, Shiloh, Lafayette Springs, Stone Mountain and the grave of Nathan Bedford Forrest to name a few.

DESC: This is an interesting little natural bridge covered in a carpet of
moss. Getting to the caches takes you through the many layers of
the area. The trek will take you across the top of the bluff with
many outlooks, then gets you down in the rock formations an onto an
interesting slickrock area halfway down the bluff. After finding
the cache you can work your way to below the bluffs to the valley
floor.

This is a cache in a series I am going to call The Bridges of
Saline Co. highlighting some of the natural bridges around Garden
of the Gods. This hidden gem is just one of the spectacular rock
formations you will see at Garden of the Gods. 
It is a bit off the beaten path just off the Wilderness Trail 1/2
mile from the main rock formations of the Observation trail. This
area of GoG is less visited and is in a more natural state. I
really enjoy visiting GoG and climbing around, on and under all the
bluffs and rock formations and finding things that can&apos;t be seen
from the tops of the bluffs and trails. 
 
Getting to this cache is not difficult but it is by no means a
direct trek and you will not be able to just follow the arrow on
the GPS. 

To get to the cache follow the Wilderness Trail from the parking
lot to the turn off to Noah&apos;s Ark (N37 36.583 W88 23.311), then
work your way down below Noah&apos;s Ark to the slickrock area below the
upper bluff to the slickrock area (N37 36.563 W88 23.323).
Depending on your scrambling skills from here you work your way
down to the cache. If you continue east past the slickrock into the
trees, 8 year old Chloe easily made it down to the bridge. 
Be careful of wet areas and moss on rounded sandstone they can be
very slippery. I have not explored the valley but I have seen the
lush moss covered bluff and plan to explore the next time I am up
this way. You can get down to the valley floor west of the cache.

2009-10-11 Dr Pantz, Wow, this was far more challenging that we signed up for, not that I&apos;m complaining.  All 4 kids, even the 4 year old, made it out across the bridge to find the cache.  This was one of those caches where you ask yourself about every 5 minutes, &quot;Are you sure this is right?&quot;  We will not soon forget this one.  Perhaps there was an easier, safer way to get in/out of this one, but we couldn&apos;t find it.  We did slip a couple times on the moss, so please be careful, folks.  We left TB Cait that was much beloved by my 9 year old for the past month since we found it in WI.  

We had so much fun in Garden of the Gods that we came back the next day to do some of the other trails.  TFTC.
Write note
2009-09-28 GEO.JOE, Photohiker, I am going to say that you are first to find since it has been published. Chloe@night was with me at the bridge when I placed it and she wanted to hunt it. As she was signing it Mike, G and Brenda  came down below the bluff where we could see them and they us so in jest Mike asked Chloe if she had signed his name. He told her that he had a kid so that she could do all the hard work for him and he didn&apos;t have to climb around to get down there. I told her she should make him come down to sign it but I don&apos;t know what she signed but they were there before it was listed so they were just beta testers ;  ). 


I hope you had an enjoyable day at Garden of the Gods revisiting all of the places.

2009-09-28 photohiker13, Saw this cache pop up after I got back home from Utah.  I knew exactly where the natural bridge was.  Again, secrets of the Gardens revealed.  I had originally seen this arch while coming from the creek below and travelling up the canyon.  TFTC.  Don&apos;t know if this is an FTF because there was already names on the log, but no date.

DESC: A nano located in the heart of Mayfield. 


You will understand why I named this cache when you get to the
location. I upped the diff. level because of the potential for
muggles. REMEMBER: It is better to give than receive! Give back to
the sport by placing caches. If you hide it, they will
come!

2009-11-08 Geogolfer1, Found this one while in Mayfield for a reception for an art show time4photo had a piece in.  This one took me a while;  I&apos;ve never seen a cache hidden this way before. Had dozens of eyes on me during my search.  [By the way, the magnet is not secure in the cache -- It popped out on me as I was going to screw the two pieces back together.]  TFTC

wow. nice cache. I found it almost immediately, but we had to wait like 10 minutes to put it back out of the &quot;eyes&quot; It moved slightly to the right from where it was. I couldn&apos;t get it back in the EXACT location it was in.

somthing different.

It is it&apos;s own cache with log and a stage in a 6 cache

2009-12-21 CyclonicKWF, The month and year are winding down and in need of a cache for December I took sometime from my Holiday break to grab some caches. Since we had been visiting my wife&apos;s family in Calvert City I figured this would be a great time to hit some of the caches in Northern Land Between the Lakes.

I learned something interesting on this cache.  I took the time to read the historical on the road near this cache.  I was wondering the other day who the road was named after when we were making our annual Christmas trip to Patti&apos;s.  Now I know.  Before I searched for the cache I took some time to visit some of the names on the tombstones.  

I did not know what to expect about this cache after reading the description and some of the previous logs.  I headed to the location and found the container.  I have seen some like this before.  

I signed the log and headed on my way.  Thanks for the cache.

Thanks for the fun series.

2009-12-05 Section8_paintball, Found this one outbound from LBL in the dark.  By buddy turned around with the the light after looking on the ground and came face to face with the cache.  He hit the ground like you had pole axed him.  I almost passed out from laughing so hard.  Wish I could have ribbed him  more, but we could hear the distant banjos getting closer so back to the car and out of LBL we went!  SL TFTF

Found it
2009-11-28 adventuretrekker, On a caching adventure to LBL with Airmapper. This is the first one like this one that we found today. Enjoyed the container. Almost missed it but I turned around to say something to Airmapper and spotted it. The hardest part was getting the container opened to get to the log, but once we figured it out it helped get the others open too. SL and replaced. TFTC.

SIZE: Micro
D3.0/T2.0
DESC: Who could have believed that an apple orchard would have become this wide sport complex of ball fields, a family park above the fields, and tennis courts in the far distance? This cache is dedicated to the memory of J. Freeland &quot;Doc&quot; Hicks and his Dream.  It is a well hidden plastic lock-n-lock container with logbook, pen, and a few trinkets.  You will have to pull the top pin to retrieve the container. MUGGLE ALERT especially spring to fall.
J. Freeland &quot;Doc&quot; Hicks was born on June 15, 1918, a native of Paducah, and longtime resident of Lone Oak, McCracken County, Kentucky, and traversed these earthly bounds on November 21, 2000.

Doc Hicks graduated from Lone Oak High School where he was elected president of the freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior classes, and he also sang in the choir, played in the band, and was on the basketball team. In 1938, before graduating, he was elected the most popular boy in the school.

After attending the Texas Chiropractic College, he returned to Lone Oak and practiced as a chiropractor for eighteen years. He also served his country with pride in the United States Army Medical Corps during World War II.

Doc Hicks was an esteemed member of the Lone Oak community where he was a member of the Lone Oak Church of Christ and  was a charter member of the Lone Oak Lions Club. He held every office and helped organize Lions Clubs in Concord, Hendron, Bardwell, La Center, and Reidland communities. Doc Hicks is in the Kentucky Lions Club Hall of Fame, and in 1986, he was named a Melvin Jones Fellow, the highest award offered by Lions Clubs International. Through the Lions Club, he made many efforts to improve the community, including helping to form a water district, a sewer district, a volunteer fire department, and the four-laning of U. S. Highway 45 from Lone Oak to Paducah 

Doc Hicks was a Boy Scout master, and he created a center in Lone Oak where teenagers could socialize. He was involved with promoting tourism in the community and was a longtime member of the Paducah Ambassadors, also known as the Red Coats. The group greets visitors and members serve as hosts and tour guides, and &quot;Doc&quot; Hicks played a special role by dressing in a white or black suit and portraying a Kentucky Colonel.

Ask many about the elaborate Christmas light display and they will tell you about the thousands that drove past his home on Gum Springs Road.  Sttarted the display in 1971, it became one of the largest light displays in western Kentucky and southern Illinois, using the light show to help charities by encouraging visitors to donate canned goods and cash as they passed his house. He eventually donated the display to the City of Paducah, and it is now part of an even larger display each holiday season in Noble Park

It was also through his efforts beginning in 1956, that a community park was established in Lone Oak, and he volunteered hundreds of hours to develop and expand the former 25-acre apple that now features the Lions Community Building, 7 baseball/softball fields, 10 tennis courts, and picnic shelters. In a 1996 ceremony, Lone Oak Park deservingly became &quot;Doc&quot; Hicks Park.

2009-12-19 RUSaved2, I am not sure if the cache owner is aware, but someone has placed a &quot;bunch&quot; of No Trespassing&quot; signs up around GZ.  We took our chances, hoping we wouldn&apos;t get shot at or thrown in jail and made the find.  Actually, Tgiz came up big for us on this one...again [:)].  Really nice cache;  just wish we didn; t have to trespass to get it.

Temporarily Disable Listing
2009-12-01 ILReviewer, Based on the previous logs, I&apos;m temporarily disabling this cache.  When the owner checks in, if it is replaced, they can re-enable the cache by posting an &apos;enable&apos; log to the cache page.  If the cache owner does not contact me by posting a note on this page by December 15, I&apos;ll assume the cache needs to be archived.

2009-11-26 myotis, Don&apos;t understand why this one is still actve.  It is obviously gone again.  Please replace it or shut it down.  But please don&apos;t mislead people into thinking it is there by keping it active when it is obvioulsy not there.  Other than this cache, I have been impressed with how well the cahces are kept up in the Murphysboro area..  .

Made it to Murphysboro right at dusk, but we weren&apos;t sure if we found enough caches to meat our goal, so we headed to Riverside Park to try to find this series in the dark.  This one was missing.

2009-11-07 TsukiakariUsagi, So today was a journey to break a lot of personal records... 1 day, 1 city, 31 caches bookmarked, 9 hours of daylight (8:15am - 5:15pm)... After it was all said and down, there were 23 total attempts at caches, 17 of those were found, 4 were DNF&apos;s, and 2 were noted due to various circumstances. The following is a story of one of those caches:
-----
This was going to be the sixteenth cache of the day;  however, I believe it has been muggled, as it has been in the past.  The GPS coordinates lead me right up to what looks like an excellent cache hidey-hole, but there is nothing to be seen there, or anywhere in the immediate vacinity.  I looked around the area, even places that were most likely beyond the coordinates boundaries, just to be on the safe side.  If it wasn&apos;t muggled, the flood waters got it, because the water isn&apos;t far from the road near the cache and I was told that the water completely covered this road not a few days prior to this weekend.  If you go and check it out and it&apos;s still there, I&apos;d like to know so I can go back after it.  Thanks!

2009-10-23 mrsnone, Great hide!  I was actually first to find the NEW cache placed.  This is a fairly busy place.. there was a boy scout camping excursion that day!  Was with davem56, brooklynn00, and maryk8.  We each took a coin and replaced with a little something.  TFTC
