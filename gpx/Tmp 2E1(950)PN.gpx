2009-12-23 Wildsurvivor, The travel oak coin No. 82 released by me and placed by Smallgamehunter and found by cepterjocky82 in sign from above on November 16 has ended its journey. Cepterjocky82 (Chad Thorp) along with his wife Nicole were killed in a traffic accident near Godfrey Illinois on December 20 2009 leaving behind their infant son Dalton.
The wildsurvive.com oak travel coin 82 was placed in Chad Thorps grave thus ending both their journeys.May they rest in piece.

Multi-cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: First cache in my hometown, Ste. Genevieve, the oldest town west of the Mississippi River. Very easy multi-cache.
A bit of thorns likely for the last 5 Meters. 

First location: drive by;  second location: less than 500 feet from  car to cache depending on where you park.
Round Mound of Sound  N 37-58.739  W 090-02.754

This cache is dedicated to Ste.Genevieve, the oldest town west of the Mississippi, and its most popular hometown singer Jim Akins (aka: the round mound of sound)

Go to the posted co-ordinates and look for the oldest brick building west of the Mississippi river. Just a little math will solve the cache. The year The Old Brick was built is &quot;A&quot;. The final is located at N37-59.(A-824) and W090-03.(A-1497)

** A local cacher will maintain cache when needed.

2009-11-07 L Frank, We knew this was going to be a nice caching day, so we decided to grab a few close to home, head south, and see how far we get. We got the date, and we also found where the coords were writen. The written coords to us to a sinkhole in the park, and the numbers that we calculated from the date took us to the cache. Not sure if this was intentional. Nice hiding spot on the final. TNL Frank. Thanks, rixart, for the cache.

There were once a few more letterboxes and geocaches on this trail
but they have been lost to vandals and weather . This is a long
trail so there is room for more boxes that way others can Bring
their bikes along and search for those too. The parking lot on Old
Troy Road is completed and the best place to park. UPDATE: 7/2/01:
Went out this morning with the kids and found the box open and
spread out with little chew marks on the ziplocks! Okay Geocachers
start bringing your own food when you go treking! :O) To be more
real: there are little critters out there in them thar woods.
Please make sure this box is placed between the railroad tie and
the fence when you put it back and put rocks on top the box AND
THEN top it off with the short tree/log for good measure. Thanks.

I make my way down the path and figured i would even run it, though i was saving the run for the last cache of the day. I get to the site and walk about and about and find a whacked out dog sitting in the trench, not sure if he was really cooky or not but was not about to find out. I crossed elsewhere and creeped up to the cache in hopes that the pup would not do anything. made my way out and not a scratch, though i think i still have mud on my shoes.

D1.5/T2.5
DESC: 2 stage multi-cache, 1/4 mile from parking to co-ordinates.
Slippery after rains. Stay on the path to avoid sinkholes and rough terrain.
Rock &apos;N&apos; Roll

This easy little multi-cache will lead you to a very unusual geological feature in Perry county,Missouri.
 Ball Mill Resurgence.
The best route is, from whatever direction, to go to the intersection of Highway 61 and &quot;V&quot; road just North of Perryville Mo. Proceed North on V to Saline Junction. There take  State Road 916 NE  to the&quot;Natural Area&quot; parking lot. Do not park on SR 914.  SR 916 can also be accessed from Hwy 51 via SR 920. But the way is trickier.
Watch the curves on these small back roads.
There are small wooden signs with &quot;Natural Area&quot; on them that direct you to the parking area from Saline junction.
The best time to observe the resurgence would be after a day or two of heavy rain. The path is sure to be slippery then, and covered by running water in a few places . If you go at any other time, you&apos;ll just have to use your imagination.
Please note, collececting geological specimens is prohibited.
The cache is not at the posted co-ordinates. Container is an orange first-aid box.
At the posted co-ordinates you will find an information board with a diagram.
On the diagram are a number of blue arrows. Use these arrows to find the cache.

 N 37  48.(# of arrows x 23)+1
W 089  53.(# of arrows x 17)-5

Please replace the cache just as you find it and cover well.
A local cacher (Nephew4) will maintain cache when needed.

2009-07-30 FRIED OKRA, This is one of the greatest cache locations that I&apos;ve NOT seen.  I hiked the trail under the cover of darkness.  I needed this cache for the DeLorme challenge and wanted to move on down the road so I decided to go after it.  As I was hiking the slippery trail in the dark listening to the barred owls (who cooks for you?), a coyote, cicadas, frogs, and who knows what else, I thought - should I be scared to be out here by myself?  I guess the answer was no because I was really enjoying the hike.   I hiked the loop and found the information that I needed then hiked back and found the final location.  The creek was not rocking tonight.  Thanks for a great cache in an awesome location.  If I&apos;m ever in the area after a rain, I&apos;ll stop in and check it out again.

The second stage of this cache is in walking distance and no bushwacking required.  This is cleverly disguised that is why we are rating it a difficulty of 4.  When you find these please be careful to replace both caches the way you found them.

Please park just north of the hospital at the parking area for the south access to the nature trail.  This area is maintained by the Salem Parks and Recreation Dept.  Please CITO and stay on the trails as much as possible. 

This cache was placed at the same time as two others to let you enjoy the trails that are wide and well maintained.  Watch out for bicycles while walking. This area is well used and you also need to watch out for mugglers.  Please replace the cache just the way you found it so others will enjoy the hunt. 

When you stand at the front of the cemetery you will notice a newer headstone with &quot;Dickins Cemetery&quot; on the top.  You will get the information needed off of this stone and the stone to the south.  Once you solve the coordinates you will be looking for a small cache with a log and when placed it had a travel bug.

The dates you are looking for are:
The day of the month that John S Chandler died May AB, 1864
Joseph Chitwoods year of death CDEF
The new coordinates are:
N 38 39.0AB   W 088 56.DFC

DESC: A quick multi-cache at a small town cemetery
This cemetery is actually the 2nd created by the town of Mason.  The first is south about a half mile but is no longer accessible.  Driving down the road and looking to the west you may be able to see some of the markers but that area hasn&apos;t been used for well over 60 years.

This cache has been placed with permission and you will not have to disturb any grave markers when finding this cache.  The listed coords will take you to a statue placed in 1903 in the memory of those who served during the American Civil War.  From that location go 350ft at a bearing of 90deg. for the final.  The final is a ammo can with various trade items.  Also included is s new LED handheld flashlight as a FTF prize.

This cache contains a medium size log book.  As such I&apos;d like for everyone loggin this find to right a little bit about your experiences.

D1.5/T1.5
DESC: You are looking for a small container not at the coordinates noted above.
Marion County, like most counties, at one time had a one-room school every two miles so that no child would have to walk more than a mile to school.  Alas, most of these have disappeared.  For some, the buildings are totally gone;  for some, the buildings now serve other purposes.

Marion County is unusual in that there is an organization attempting to determine the location of each of the one-room schools and mark the location with a sign.  Many school location signs have been placed, but not all.  As is usually the case, lack of donations and information slows the process down.  [If you have information about an unmarked one-room school in Marion County, email me via geocaching.com and I will attempt to put you in contact with the organization.]

This cache is at the location of what is believed to be last one-room school to cease operation.  Enjoy.

The cache is not at the coordinates given above.  The above coordinates are that of an intersection where you might consider turning, unless, of course, you are going in the proper direction without turning.  The cache is about one-half mile away from the intersection.

The stereograms below provide the actual coordinates of the cache and a 3D picture of the actual cache hiding place.  If you are not familiar with stereograms, start with one of the coordinate stereograms and relax your eyes until you see three dots above it -- not two and not four.  At this time, your eyes will not be focused on exactly the same place, but you can see the 3D image of the coordinate.  After noting that coordinate, move to the next stereogram to get the other coordinate.  Then try the 3d close-up photo of the cache location.  

There are many stereograms on the Internet.  If these interest you, you might search for more information.

Charles Weyland, the billionaire industrialist, has discovered
the Antarctic temple using thermal imaging satellites. Thinking
that this could be the site of mankind&apos;s Master Culture, he
assembles a crack team, Jurassic Park-style, to go take a look.
What they find, instead of a manmade temple, is a Predator temple
where five young hunters are about to conduct their first Alien
hunt. The Predator weapon of choice is a six-bladed shuriken
throwing star, while the Aliens use their trademark
infest-and-impale method of fighting.
The humans, of course, get caught in the middle of it. If you
want to survive, go to the posted coordinates to catch the next
shuttle home, or choose your weapon of choice(garmin or

This is where you use frisbees instead of golf balls. The chains catch the frisbees. If you get any time, try playing this different game. It is a lot of fun. Enjoy.

SIZE: Micro
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: You are looking for a micro at the posted coordinates, just across the road from the below described area.  Yes, it will take some imagination to envision how this farm must have appeared as we share this Bit of History.
This look into the past has been described as a ?Showcase Farm? or an ?Oasis of Elegance?.  Private railroad cars pulled to the siding at Tonti and lavishly dressed men and women disembarked in gilded coaches for the H. Lee Borden farm.  A farm of 964 acres bought by the son of the Chicago condensed milk magnate, with the intention of making the farm the epitome of gracious rural life.
Picture this: a 22 room mansion, all the farm buildings, outbuildings to house the assortment of prize polled Durham cattle, registered horses, sheep, hogs, poultry, pigeons, peacocks, Belgian rabbits and collie dogs, and 30 hired hands living on the farm.
The land was built up by trainloads of manure shipped down from the Chicago stockyards, and farmers of the area would be hired at 50 cents a load to haul it in their wagons from the Tonti station to the farm.
This was simply Mr. Borden?s ?place to rest?, having homes in Chicago and Connecticut.  The Borden?s were said to have visited the Pope in Rome on several occasions.
An avid sportsman, Mr. Borden died in 1904 after eating duck that had not been properly iced upon bagging. This botulism was then called ?duck sickness?.
The farm had its own generating device for supplying electricity to the house and barns at a time when few farmers had the service.  The Borden farm was always ?lit up like a Christmas tree and quite a splendid sight at night.?
The farm had gardens and a deer park, and many people came from miles around to view the place, some bringing their lunches and spending the day on the grounds.
The family remained here until fire destroyed the palatial mansion in 1920.
We hope you enjoyed this glimpse into the past.

D1.5/T1.5
DESC: A micro cache can be found at the posted coordinates just a short distance north of the historical sign about this site.
In the local IGA parking lot you may notice the historical marker signifying the sight of the second structure built in this community. The first settlers arrived in 1811, settling here began in 1813, in an area of half prairie and half timber.  The road at this sight became one of the great thoroughfares of the Union as it opened up a route between Vincennes and St. Louis. The cost to stay overnight in 1820 was 12 ½ cents for you and 50 cents for your horse.
Early sidewalks were the first public works project completed in 1857 with the corporation furnishing the lumber and nails, and the property owners laying the walk in a ?good and workmanlike manner?.
Early streets were dirt and maintenance done by each male person over 21 and under 50.  If the work was not done, the man was assessed 75 cents per day if paid when or before notified to work, otherwise he was paid $1 per day.  The brick pavement was laid on S. Broadway in 1899, with the roads lagging behind the sidewalks which were ?granitoid? at a cost of $19.95 per foot.
Open Range was allowed until an 1860 ordinance limiting some free roaming during the wetter seasons of Nov. 1 thru April 1.  Opposition led by Silas Bryan (father of William Jennings Bryan) against this passage was because of believing that keeping animals in pens was considered against nature.  Although passed in 1860 it was not vigorously reinforced until 1879.  
Now, you may understand why most homes of the time had fences, not just to keep animals in as we would have expected.  Hope you have enjoyed this glimpse into the past from our Bit of History in Marion County.

DESC: This micro cache is easily accessible as a pull-off is available.
This Bit of History is a story coming from the Hickory Hill School area told of how people stayed connected around the 1930?s;   They had telephone lines owned by the farmers who wanted a phone and who helped form a company and maintain the lines.  There were about 20 people to a company.  The phones had two dry cell batteries and a generator.  In order to call your neighbor, you turned the crank as many times as needed.  Long and short rings were used and each person heard the ring for all that had a phone.  
In case of an emergency they would ring five or more shorts and everyone knew help was needed and would go to the phone to find out where.  It was also the way news was spread around as they didn?t have radios, televisions, or daily newspapers in those days.
They had a switch where several lines came in so they could be connected with other lines by a knife switch operated by the switchman who got a small fee for his services. Later this system was replaced with the Bell system.
Hope you have learned a little from this bit of Marion County history.

&quot;M&quot; is the new member of Team Eagle 1977 and is joining us for Christmas &apos;07 and we just wanted to show her some caching hospitality by honoring her with a cache by her name, or a derivative.
To share some background as to our long-distance caching Saturday conversations this is one example: We had been out since 5:30 a.m. in the first stages of our biggest caching day when Team Eagle 1977 called to see how we were doing. Now in WY the caching is much different, with high terrains and some distance to hike so we don&apos;t have the same type of days to share by any means. At that point we had 25 cache retrievals already. The voice from the passenger seat was heard to say, &quot;Isn&apos;t that precious&quot;, in a Georgia accent. Well, we knew what she meant!
It&apos;s been fun to have this Team to share caching stories with and we are glad &quot;M&quot; could come to our neck of the woods to find a few caches without the long treks.

Team Eagle 1977 will be with us through Christmas &apos;07 and we wanted to share basic cache to get them warmed up for a big day in the area.
To give you some background: some months ago we received a phone call from this team as they were beginning their day of caching in WY, which is much different than here, both in  terrain and cache hiders. We were in the early stages of our biggest caching day, as they check into see how many we had to that point. Having started  caching that morning at 5:30 we had around 25 cache retrievals already. The voice from the passenger seat was heard to say, &quot;Isn&apos;t that precious&quot;, in a Georgia accent. Well, we knew what she meant!
Now &quot;M&quot; is joining us for Christmas and we wanted to share some personal caches. This being our second in her honor. It&apos;s been fun to have others enjoy this sport as we do.

This name came from a phone conversation with Team Eagle 1977 while we were at the early stages of our biggest caching day. As they in WY were starting their caching day by filling the tank they called to ask how our day was going.  Having started  caching that morning at 5:30 we had around 25 cache retrievals already. The voice from the passenger seat was heard to say, &quot;Isn&apos;t that precious&quot;, in a Georgia accent. Well, we knew what she meant!... 

FYI - There are more caches between Lawrenceville and Marshall than in the state of Wyoming.   However, we were caching in Owensboro, Ky that morning and there are more caches in Owenboro than in the state of Wyoming, too.

DESC: This is one of a series of caches that will be hidden by Park Rangers of the US Army Corp of Engineers. It is located near the National Great Rivers Museum and is also near the MCT Confluence bike trail.
Headwaters are the place where a river begins.  The Mississippi River starts in Minnesota at Lake Itasca.  At the source, a river will be small and will grow larger as tributaries meet with the river.  
The Mississippi River flows through the middle of the United States to the Gulf Mexico.  Along its banks are important port cities such as Minneapolis, St. Louis, Memphis, Baton Rouge and New Orleans.  This makes the river a prime place for navigation.

We met up with Zach, a local boy muggle about nine or ten years old, when we first arrived, when he asked us if we knew whose bike was lying on its side next to the trail. “We&apos;re from out of town...” was Mean Gene&apos;s reply and we went down the trail to GZ. A few minutes later, Zach was back, asking what we were doing. We explained, and he went off with The Rooter to help with the searching. A few minutes later Mean Gene found the cache where we&apos;d already looked twice before, and we showed Zach the cache and swore him to secrecy before we left. TNLNSL.

Get Your Kicks On Route 66
 Enjoy your drive down the Mother Road.

The intent of this series is to point out
historic or unique places along old route 66 between IL and CA. It
is NOT meant to be a power trail as caches may be 50 miles or more
apart. Stop and enjoy these sights along the way. 


In every generation and in every species, a star is born. And
for one lucky family living along famed ROUTE 66 in Staunton
Il. that celebrity came in the unlikely form of a rabbit named
Montana. Montana, who passed away June 26, 2008 had
been dazzling guests at Henry&apos;s Rabbit
Ranch for more than 7 years. In October of 2005 I became
one of her fans when she &apos;autographed&apos; my ROUTE 66 brochure.
That first autograph inspired me to continue to gather signatures
from other folks, both famous and undiscovered, along America&apos;s
Road. Apparently Montana inspired others as well since
there was an effort to have her run for PRESIDENT. She even
had her own bumper sticker and Web Site.

CLICK HARE


So if you?re in the mood for some good times along the MOTHER
ROAD, then Henry&apos;s Rabbit
Ranch in Staunton, Illinois is a ?must see?. And if
rabbits are your particular passion then Rich and Linda Henry have
created your HUTCH ON EARTH. They have both types. The
hopping kind and the VW kind!


Henry&apos;s Rabbit Ranch is Rich
Henry&apos;s labor of love. About ten years ago Rich and Linda took a
trip to California on ROUTE 66 and noticed the lack of
visitor centers. When Rich got back home to Staunton he decided to
do something about that and built this visitor center. Times have
changed and ROUTE 66 is seeing a rebirth all along the
highway, and Henry&apos;s Rabbit Ranch
was at the forefront of this movement. It is their contribution to
America&apos;s Main Street.
Henry&apos;s Rabbit Ranch celebrates
THE MOTHER ROAD and the people along the highway with it&apos;s
emporium of highway and trucking memorabilia that includes a
collection of Campbell&apos;s &quot;HUMPIN&apos; TO PLEASE&quot;
trailers next to a replica of a vintage gas station.
Henry&apos;s Rabbit Ranch Station and Visitor&apos;s
Center looks like a real old classic filling station
once found all along Route 66.



 
Rich and Linda Henry are ROUTE 66 authorities who enjoy
sharing their memories of the MOTHER ROAD with visitors from
all over the world. They both grew up in the shadow of the
celebrated highway. In fact both of their fathers are in the
Illinois Hall of Fame in McLean, Illinois.
As you wander about the grounds of the RABBIT RANCH you
won?t have any trouble finding this MICRO. It has been
placed with the permission of the owners with the understanding
that caching will be limited to DAYLIGHT HOURS.
Congratulations to lobocs for being
FTF.

The intent of this series is to point out

If you are looking for the &quot;REAL DEAL&quot; along ROUTE
66 then the ARISTON CAFE in
Litchfield Illinois is for you. It has been placed on the
National Register Of Historic Places and inducted into the
ROUTE 66 Illinois Hall Of Fame. For more than seventy years,
THREE generations of the ADAM FAMILY have been
serving delicious meals in a classy setting complete with table
cloths, fresh cut flowers and a mouth watering dessert tray.
In 1924 Greek immigrant Pete Adam built his first restaurant in
Carlinville, Illinois along ROUTE 4 which was an early alignment of
the MOTHER ROAD. With the rerouting of ROUTE 66 Pete
knew he needed to go where the highway went so in 1929 he leased
some property in Litchfield and built a new restaurant. The
original Litchfield restaurant was located across the street from
the present location. With the success of his first Litchfield
restaurant Pete built a new building on the present site in 1935.
The design of the Ariston Cafe does not reflect any particular
architectural style. Instead, it was built in a utilitarian style,
common for small commercial buildings of it&apos;s time. Nevertheless,
the building does contain elements of the popular Art Deco
style of the time period in it&apos;s interior booths. The Ariston&apos;s
most distinguishing exterior features are the curved parapet wall
on the front facade and it&apos;s varied brick work. Originally, the
Ariston, like many ROUTE 66 businesses, also sold fuel.


The Ariston&apos;s motto has always
been &quot;Remember Where Good Food is
Served&quot; and their customers have done just that as it is
still going strong today! The Ariston is believed to be the oldest
operating restaurant on ROUTE66. Although the majority of
the Ariston&apos;s diners are now locals, second generation owners Nick
and Demi Adam still get motorists who are following the OLD
ROAD. &quot;We see a good number of Americans,&quot; Demi says. &quot;But we
see thousands and thousands of Europeans. They&apos;re taking four to
six weeks to drive ROUTE 66. Some are on their honeymoon,
and many do it more than once.&quot;
After finding this Micro we hope you check out the
interior of this iconic MOTHER ROAD gem. The owners would
like to hear from you. They love meeting their guests, especially
those who are traveling the MOTHER ROAD. Chances are they
will even invite you behind the counter to have your picture taken
under their WORLD FAMOUS SIGN.
EXTRA CREDIT
When you log the cache, post a picture of yourself or group under
the famous sign (or elsewhere at this establishment).




Congratulations to lobocs for being
FTF.

DESC: Just off I-55, an easy cache and a place to drop off travel bugs and geocoins.
This is an easy cache a short distance off of the highway.  If you have bugs or coins that need to move north or south, this is a good location to set them free.  The container is not typical, but you should be able to spot it very easily.

If you take a travel bug or geocoin, please leave a travel bug or geocoin.  We do not condone stealing or taking of TBs and geocoins.  By stealing these items, you&apos;re being a thief.  Please do not take a TB or geocoin unless you&apos;re willing to move it on.  These items are for the enjoyment of the entire geocaching community and not for the collections of the those individuals who feel they have a right to this type of collectable.  

If you do not know how to track an item or register it as being picked up/dropped off by you, feel free to contact the owner of the cache for directions or advise.

Let&apos;s try and make this a regular cache again.  Hopefully everyone stays honest and doesn&apos;t steal anything.

2009-11-07 TsukiakariUsagi, So today was a journey to break a lot of personal records... 1 day, 1 city, 31 caches bookmarked, 9 hours of daylight (8:15am - 5:15pm)... After it was all said and down, there were 23 total attempts at caches, 17 of those were found, 4 were DNF&apos;s, and 2 were noted due to various circumstances. The following is a story of one of those caches:
-----
This was my twenty-second cache of the day... I finally found it but not before having to rely on the hint.  I thought it was where it was at first, looked, didn&apos;t find it, got frustrated because it was starting to get a little dark outside as the sun was nearing sunset and wanted to at least get one or two more caches in before it got totally dark outside.  Once I read the hint, I found it pretty quickly and was off to what turned out to be my final attempt for the day.  TFTC!

2009-11-28 deercreekth, This cache just doesn&apos;t want me to find it.  The weeds were mostly gone today.  I checked all of the places I did the last time I looked for it, and some other places I hadn&apos;t checked before.  I just couldn&apos;t find it.  Oh well, I came through town to look for a couple of other caches, so this one would have just been a bonus.  I&apos;ll keep an eye on this page, and may come take a look again sometime.  I was excited to see that Uniontown has a Dollar General Store now.  I saw that Corydon had one on the way through there last night.  Some of the smaller towns in the area are becoming big time now.

We did look around the most likely spot&apos;s &amp; didn&apos;t find it. So we placed a new cache with a new log in a spot &amp; took new coords of this hide &amp; was going to change them, But as we get home &amp; I check the listed coords with the coords on our GPSr. I believe we hid this new cache in the place where the old one was (I thought it was the right spot in the first place,,lol) Anyway&apos;s, Going to keep the listed coords as they are. We didn&apos;t find the old cache, but it could still be there or near by?? Well, The new cache is there &amp; ready to be found. If you find either the old or new cache, Just sign one of them.
If you find them both. Please let me know &amp; place it next to the other.

2009-07-27 deercreekth, I spent several minutes looking for this, but couldn&apos;t come up with it.  Depending on how far into the outskirts it is, the weeds may have been tall enough to conceal it.  I&apos;ll have to come back this winter.

I have relatives that live near here, but never noticed that Uniontown has a city cemetery.  After looking for the cache, I went and did a river check like I used to.  The river&apos;s really down.  It was good to see that the house with a deck that you can see while driving up the hill is still there.  There used to be a woman who would sunbathe on that deck around 20 years ago.  She had total privacy... except to people driving up the hill to the boat dock.  Thanks for giving me an excuse to drive around Uniontown again.

Interesting location. I signed the log and moved on down the road with the storm coming up quick behind me.

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4913. (50 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

Very cool cache. Took some looking before we found it. A neighbor next door hollered at us and told us the real treasure was in the back! We told him that we already found the gold and was just logging our visit.. Very cool to have neighbors that nice!

2009-08-25 Gerhardus, What a day!!! Brawny Bear, Happykraut and I drove 3 hrs to meet up with Mike Anderson1492 for a little geocaching. We had over 200 caches on our list but we wondered just how many we could do. I&apos;m thinking we stopped at almost 150+ caches and logged about 140. This shattered my old personel best of 57. Great day and great company. Brawny managed to squeak over 5000.  What a day indeed! TFTC!!

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4891. (28 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

This cache is in Spindler Park and is a little larger then a 35mm film canister.  The cache itself contains a log only so, please bring your own writing utensil.  If you are like me, while you are searching you enjoy reading the description and clues allowed for assistance.  Well, since there are usually a few people around this area you may want to pipe down and speak softly or you will attract attention to yourself.  One other funny thing about this corner of the universe is, no matter what time or day you are here, MEN are always about 30 feet away!

I will trust that you have read the cache name and description carefully therefore will not need an additional hint to make the find.

After finding the cache, we turned around and headed back the way we came as something ran across the street. I asked Fuzzy if it was a headless horseman, and he said no, it was the head!

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

This cache is placed very near the High Water mark for the flood of June 2008, if you stand at N38° 54.429  W087° 54.460  you would have gotten your feet wet after the levy burst.   This is so close to Pierceburg I should have had it out sooner.

2009-11-15 LennyTheLizard, Went on a cache run today to try to beat our &quot;most finds in a day&quot; record (14).   This one was much easier in the fall with a lot less greenery to walk through.  I spent several minutes looking in the wrong place, even though my GPS said I was right on top of it.  Once I tried a broader circle, I found it pretty easy.  Swapped a plastic lizard for a plastic dinosaur and signed log.

2009-11-27 Forester Al, Was caching with my son and nephews before the big Thanksgiving feast.  Found the first stage of the easily enough after I went to the right shelterhouse.  The boys really enjoyed the first stage, and I found it exceedingly amusing and creative.  The second part of the cache though proved a challenge though.  My old Garmin Etrex was not up for the task.  I did find the general area, and though the clue was appropriate, it didn&apos;t set me on the path to the find.  After about 20 minutes, I received a call from Mrs. Forester Al telling me the feast would be on the table in 30 minutes, so I had to leave.  Most disappointing, but I will be back.

2009-11-20 TEAMR&amp;R, Out for the SLAGA County Challenge. This is a cache find for Franklin County IL. This is #27 for IL. It was dark and we were tired, so this was our last cache for the day.

Post Reviewer Note
2009-12-14 ILReviewer, It appears that this cache has been disabled for quite some time.  Is it going to be replaced or should it be archived to make room for possible future caches? If the cache owner does not contact me by posting a note on this page by December 28, I&apos;ll assume the cache needs to be archived.

Look throughly by all the logs in the area.  As others have mentioned it is really swampy/muddy in the area.  It looked like this area has flooded.

I really needed to get back out on the road and headed home.  I saw a couple of good spots where it might have been and was close to the GPS coordinates, but came up with nothing.  Maybe I needed more time to look and/or a wider search area that was dryer.

 <sym>Unknown Cache</sym>
 <desc>Milton Cemetery by LowePerf Jr. &amp; LowePerf
Cache ID: GC1HHFF
Unknown Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T2.0
DESC: Welcome to historic Milton Cemetery.
Founded in 1809, the village of Milton was formed when John Wallace
and Walter Seely built two sawmills on the Wood River in this area.
The village consisted of the sawmills, a gristmill, a distillery, a
store and a tavern. Unfortunately, the dam that went along with the
mills created dead water that fostered mosquitoes and soon a
malaria outbreak. By 1820, forty people had died and buried in what
is now Milton Cemetery. Without any way to control the outbreak the
village was abandoned. 
 
 In the cemetery you will find graves dated from 1819 up until more
modern times. Rumor even has it that two members of the Lewis &amp;amp; 
Clark expedition are buried here, even though this has never been
proven. The cemetery fell into disrepair until around 1988 when,
thanks to the Alton VFW Post 1308 and East Alton American Legion
Post 794 restored it to it&apos;s current condition.
 
 The above coordinates will get you to a parking area. The simple
puzzle below must be solved to get the final coordinates.
 N 38 53.!*( 
W 090 .07.$^) 
After getting the cache take a minute to enjoy the view.Additional Waypoints
Hint: The puzzle can be solved easily if you [b][i]don&apos;t[/i][/b] start [b][i]shift[/i][/b]ing things around.

Leaping and running as fast as his 4 legs could carry him down the hill and out of sight. LOL To say we were startled is an understatement. Very nice Cache, contents were dry.

Only one close call when half of us started to slide down the hill by the cache after crossing the last creek and would have ended back up in the creek like Graciedi if not for a quick save by the other half.

2008-11-08 graciedi, What can I say, Bryan Ackerman?  Returned to the search today with 4HGal and the coordinates led us to it.  But that was after crossing 2 creeks.  Do you know how difficult it is for 2 fluffy women to cross a creek once let alone twice?  I did a lot of tree hugging to get to it but was finally victorious while 4HGal stayed on the other side of the creek and acted as chief adviser (and laughed her head off).  I was feeling pretty good after signing the log and replacing cache - that is until I slipped and fell into a patch of thorns (there&apos;s a reason why my name is gracie).  It wasn&apos;t so bad going down but trying to get up out of it was painful.  I still felt pretty good about getting this one.  Your ears must have been burning there for a while, I&apos;m sure.

Anyway, we searched for a bit and I finally spotted the right place to look. Unfortunately the cache log was really soaked. Uncle Chris had a piece of paper in his truck that we used as a substitute log. My guess is it&apos;s going to be get wet again soon, though.

After two DNF&apos;s I really wanted to end my day with at least one more find. This one was on the way so it seemed like a perfect one to go for.

Unfortunately about a mile from the cache I found a spot where the road was completely covered in water. Hmmmmm...do I turn back or go through? I decided to go on through, but started to wonder about that decision a quarter of the way through. However at this point, backing up and letting the water flow into my tailpipe didn&apos;t seem like a good idea, so I sallied forth!

Made it through with little trouble...and a little steam coming off the engine. Another seven tenths down the road I found the cache. Phew!

I was glad not to end the day with a DNF! I pulled up the coordinates for home and headed that way!

Well....what do you know? Another cache in my way!

2009-05-01 CYBret, Yikes! Two DNF&apos;s in a row! 

I&apos;m a little confused on this one. I searched all over and turned up with nothing, however there was a find only two days ago! Maybe I&apos;m losing my touch! [:(]

The only thing I found was a clip on air freshener (the kind you put on your car&apos;s vent). It seemed like an odd thing to use as a container and there wasn&apos;t any log in it, so I doubt that&apos;s the container.

The rain was starting to come down now, so I hopped back into the Durango and headed towards home...well...after a couple more caches.

2009-02-15 MutherAndSun, After watching the others have fun at the Valentine&apos;s event and subsequent caching yesterday, I needed to get in some nice country road drives and caches today and practice using GrandFahza&apos;s camera for some eagle viewing tomorrow. I agree with teacman about country road caches.  I usually drive through the towns without stopping for many, but will drive 10 miles out of the way for that country road cache.  It was getting dark here, so I had to bust out the magic flashlight and may have left a little drool behind from holding it in my mouth while signing the log!  TFTC
Found it
2009-02-13 teacman, All of these caches help with the numbers.  I appreciate being able to find them without spending half an hour.  It is also nice to cach out in the country away from all the muggles.

2009-02-21 4HGal, Ready to go again. New container. It will be moved just a few feet. Please remove the lid and log while leaving the container in place. My GPS took my to within feet of it. Just a tip, when walking up to a spot. The direction your GPS is pointing you as it clicks off the feet is usually pretty right on. Where we get in trouble is the closer we get to trees, buildings or other tall solid masses. Then it bounces everywhere. Sometimes if you back way off from the trees, etc then you can come at it again. Happy hunting.

Small cars should ride one tire in middle to keep from dragging and the road would probably be messy after a big rain. It is truly a shame to see these places in such bad shape. Families probably don&apos;t live around here anymore. 

Wide Open Spaces was a song recorded by the Dixie Chicks in 1998. While I may not be a great fan of theirs, I do love country music and this was a good one.

Here is another one in the country music series. Brad Paisley recorded this song on one of his albums in 2007. The reason it comes to mind lies in the southern corner of this old cemetery in the tree line. There are a number of home made stones in this area.

2009-05-16 Gerhardus, Left the St. Louis area early this morning to cache a dense bunch of caches we kept talking about South of HWY 64!  We finally set a date and made the two hour journey.  We were not disapointed despite 14 DNF&apos;s.  Thanks for the fun day in your neck of the woods.

2009-05-16 lancelot, OCW Gerhardus and Myotis on a great Saturday in May. It was a great day to be out caching and we picked up many finds for the day and this was one of them. There are a lot of caches out here in Eastern Illinois so keep placing them ad we will be back.
Found it
2009-05-16 myotis, OCW Gerhardus and Lancelot in SO IL.  Had a great day of caching.  But we had some issues with flooding preventing us from getting to caches, too many DNFs, lots of fun, and OK (windy with sprinkles) weather.  Ended up with about 50 finds for the day (and 14 DNFs ouch! Bridges drove us crazy today).  Thanks for lots of great caches and challenges.

Wynken, Blynken, and Nod 
by Eugene Field 

Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
Sailed off in a wooden shoe---
Sailed on a river of crystal light,
Into a sea of dew.
&quot;Where are you going, and what do you wish?&quot;
The old moon asked the three.
&quot;We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beautiful sea; 
Nets of silver and gold have we!&quot;
Said Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.

The old moon laughed and sang a song,
As they rocked in the wooden shoe,
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew.
The little stars were the herring fish
That lived in that beautiful sea---
&quot;Now cast your nets wherever you wish---
Never afeard are we&quot;; 
So cried the stars to the fishermen three:
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam---
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
Bringing the fishermen home; 
&apos;T was all so pretty a sail it seemed
As if it could not be,
And some folks thought &apos;t was a dream they &apos;d dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful sea---
But I shall name you the fishermen three:
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.

Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one&apos;s trundle-bed.
So shut your eyes while mother sings
Of wonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things
As you rock in the misty sea,
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.

Elba was located on the south side of the North Fork of the Saline River in Section 16-7s-8e.  It survived for nearly a century before the big flood of 1937 swept away nearly all of the physical evidence of the village. 

According to Glen Sneed&apos;s book &quot;Ghost Towns of Southern Illinois&quot;, Asa B. Tarrant and his wife Mary E., platted the village of 15 lots on November 17, 1863. A second plat added an additional eight lots in a survey of July 17, 1865. The two plats should be found in Gallatin County Deed Books W, page 578, and Y, page 199. The plats provide the name of Elba, a small Italian island in the Mediterranean memorialized in history as the final imprisonment site for the deposed French Emperor Napoleon. 

During the Civil War, Elba experienced much drunkenness among the rogues. There were many southern sympathizers in the neighborhood. One day there was a flag raising in Elba. As the flag was being fastened to the rope, a young man was holding it reverently in his arms. Then an old man staggered out of one of the saloons in a drunken stupor and spat on the flag. Another man pulled a revolver and shot the old man in the forehead, just above the bridge of the nose. He died instantly. A rider mounted his horse and started for the sheriff in Shawneetown. Some young men arrested the assailant and started picking a jury. The jury picked, a trial was held and the man was condemned to be hanged. Before the execution was carried out the sheriff arrived and took charge of matters. Because of this incident and others, products of the eight saloons, Elba acquired the name &quot;Hell&apos;s Half Acre.&quot;

2009-10-10 Hunts with Wine, Quick find?! Quick find?! We searched and searched and could NOT come up with it! The road was recently flooded with all the horrible rains we&apos;ve had so we were thinking that it might have washed away.  But then the Mudslingers usually don&apos;t hide things low. . . . So we searched some more.  STILL couldn&apos;t find it.  But I did find loads of mud on the sides, windows, tires of my Saturn. My boyfriend will be so jealous that I went muddin&apos; without him.

 <desc>Mark Hall-Prairie Cache by Myotis
Cache ID: GC1JP15
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: 
I used to have a cache near here called the Tallgrass Prairie Cache.  Mark Hall was the main person behind establishing this prairie.  He passed on November 23, 2008.  So I decided to move and rename the cache in his honor.  

Here is the original description: 

This cache is next to the Heartland Prairie in Gordon Moore Park. This is a 27 acre prairie restoration. Before settlement, 60% of Illinois was tallgrass prairie. Today less than 1/100 of 1% of Illinois is in prairie.  This site contains 132 prairie species. It almost always has spectacular displays. I have uploaded an example picture.  

This site used to be a farm field. The Sierra Club started the restoration project. Hundreds of hours were spent gathering seeds from local sources. Then they had to be stored over winter. Many had to be rubbed with sand paper. Then the seeds were planted. And finally, the area has been burned several times. The Nature Institute eventually took over the restoration project.

Mark Hall started the project.  I have many fond memories of gathering seeds, preparing seeds, planting, and burning with Mark.  Mark?s latest project was the woods behind the prairie.  He was leading the effort to convert the woods into a savannah.  While Mark was not a cacher, one time he found and signed the cache.  Latter he told me someone was looking for the cache when he was working on the prairie.  The person knew me.  Mark and I talked about the cache a couple of times but he never did any caching.  He will be missed.

The cache is a small lock and lock.  

The entrance for the site is across the highway from the main entrance to Gordon Moore Park. Park near the Heartland Prairie sign. (In the winter the area is closed after dark.) The cache is off a trail/road that starts at the SE corner of the prairie. The parking is by the trail head.  Follow the trail (just don?t take the first right) and it will take you through the prairie to the corner near the cache.  From there, there is an unpaved road through the woods that are being restored.  Stay on the road until you are about 10 feet from the cache.  Please stay on trail.

I will go back again and try to find it another day when I get a real GPS device not the HP Pocket PC that cant handle anything not on a real road.

Get Your Kicks On Route 66
 Enjoy Your Drive Down the Mother Road.

The intent of this series is to point out
historic or unique places along old route 66 between IL and CA. It
is NOT meant to be a power trail as caches may be 50 miles or more
apart. Stop and enjoy these sights along the way. 

The Chain of Rocks Bridge spans the Mississippi River on the north
edge of St. Louis, Missouri. The eastern end of the bridge is on
Chouteau Island, part of Madison, Illinois, while the western end
is on the Missouri shoreline. The bridge was used by U.S. Route 66
to cross over the Mississippi. Its most notable feature is a
22-degree bend occurring at the middle of the crossing, necessary
for navigation on the river. This bend is a compromise due to the
unique geology of the area and concerns about the navigation of
river traffic around the bridge pylons. Another interesting feature
is the Chain of Rocks, a rocky area in the Mississippi that gave
the bridge its name. This feature used to wreak havoc with river
navigation and has since been bypassed by the man-made Chain of
Rocks Canal. 

 
To log this cache:
1. Take a picture of your face with the rock ledge in the
background. This is best taken from the coordinates.
2. Go up on the bridge (you can park free near the Illinois
side) and email the following items from the sign near the center
of the bridge on the south side. The river supports how many
species of fish and how many species of mussels? What is the cubic
feet of water per second that roughly flows out to the Gulf of
Mexico? What is the first line of the quote from Mark Twain about
his book ?Life on the Mississippi.??
LOGS NOT MEETING THE CRITERIA WILL BE DELETED.
Be sure to get the virtual cache GC2258 located on the bridge
while you are there.
There is parking access to the bridge from both sides but it is
recommended to park on the Illinois side as there is better
security and car break-ins have been reported on the Missouri side.
On 06/12/09, cacher BlueBeadMan reported: &quot;...the Illinois side of
the river is just as dangerous as the Missouri side, it just
doesn&apos;t get the same publicity. You find just as much broken glass,
beer bottles, evidence of criminal activity, and things like used
condoms on the IL side as you do on the MO side. Perhaps the famous
murder case which occurred on the middle of the bridge and was
tried in MO gives the MO side a worse reputation. Who knows...the
IL side is more secluded and thereby more prone to criminal
activity than the MO side...&quot;
Originally a motor route, it now carries walking and biking
trails over the river. The chain of rocks stretch for seven miles
immediately to the north of the city of St. Louis. The
Mississippi&apos;s water, narrowed by these rock ledges, rushes through
this reach at speeds of 12 feet per second, roaring down a decline
of 11 feet in seven river miles.
Both the strange 22-degree turn in the bridge and the Chain of
Rocks owe their existence to glaciers. During the last ice age, the
Mississippi River was re-routed from its original channel in soft
river sediment to its present channel over resistant, mainly
limestone, bedrock. The river has yet to wear down the bedrock and
this feature is still a rough spot in the river. If the bridge had
been built straight, the engineers would have had to choose between
two problematic routes. One route would have put the bridge in a
location where it couldn&apos;t have been solidly founded on bedrock.
The other route would have posed problems to river navigation by
not allowing barges to line up with the current, possibly causing
them to collide with the bridge. It served as a compromise between
geological and navigational concerns.
Other changes in the course of the river have occurred because
of earthquakes along the New Madrid Fault Zone, which lies between
Memphis and St. Louis. Three earthquakes in 1811 and 1812,
estimated at approximately 8 on the Richter Scale, were said to
have temporarily reversed the course of the Mississippi. The
settlement of Reverie, Tennessee was cut off from Tipton County,
Tennessee, during the 1811 and 1812 earthquakes and placed on the
western side of the Mississippi River, the Arkansas side. These
earthquakes also created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee from the
altered landscape near the river.
The rapids seen just to the south of the bridge are actually
water spilling over the 2,925-foot low-water River Dam 27, the
first permanent rock-fill dam across a major river in the United
States. This dam was built in 1960 to insure adequate depths over
the lower sill of the old Alton Locks that was 12.5 river miles
upstream.
From the Illinois side of the bridge, signs marked &quot;HISTORIC
ROUTE 66 SPUR&quot; take travelers to the Illinois side of the bridge
and a &quot;HISTORIC ROUTE 66&quot; sign marks the Missouri side of the
bridge. The Gateway Arch is visible downriver, and immediately
downstream from the bridge, two water intakes for the St. Louis
Waterworks are visible. In the mid 1990s, a Bigfoot monster truck
drove over the &quot;chain of rocks&quot; located just downstream from the
Chain of Rocks Bridge.
A below water dam was built across the Mississippi River below
the Chain of Rocks to keep the river level high enough at the
upstream end of the canal to provide adequate flows/levels for
navigation within the canal. Just to the north of the Chain of
Rocks Bridge, the Missouri River flows into the Mississippi. The
site where these two rivers come together (confluence) was once
located on private property, but is now open for all to see thanks
to the Missouri Department of Conservation. Several trail routes to
the confluence are available from the conservation area parking
lot. The shortest route is about six miles round trip on flat
land.
Confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers is located at
Cairo, Illinois. The Missouri River flows from the confluence of
the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin to the Mississippi River.
Taken together, the Jefferson, the Missouri, and the Mississippi
form the longest river system in North America. If measured from
the source of the Jefferson at Brower&apos;s Spring, to the Gulf of
Mexico, the length of the Mississippi-Missouri-Jefferson
combination is approximately 3,900 miles, making the combination
the 4th longest river in the world. The uppermost 207 miles of this
combined river are called the Jefferson, the lowest 1,352 miles are
part of the Mississippi, and the intervening 2,341 miles are called
the Missouri.
It is a unique opportunity to be able to see two of the world?s
largest rivers combining. The water in the Missouri River flows
about 3,740 miles from its headwaters in Montana through the
Mississippi River and into the Gulf of Mexico. This combined
waterway is the world?s third longest with the Nile and Amazon
ranking first and second respectively. This feature also owes its
existence to the continental ice sheets covering North America
during the last ice age. Before this time, the Missouri River used
to flow through Canada and into the Hudson Bay. The Missouri
River?s modern day course is a good rough indicator of the
southernmost advance of the continental ice sheets.
The Mississippi River is the second longest river in the United
States, with a length of 2,340 miles from its source in Lake Itasca
in Minnesota to its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico. The longest river
in the United States is a Mississippi tributary, the Missouri
River, measuring 2,540 miles. The Mississippi River is part of the
Jefferson-Missouri-Mississippi river system, which is the largest
river system in North America and among the largest in the world:
by length, 3,900 miles, it is the fourth longest, and by its
average discharge of 572,000 cu ft/s, it is the tenth largest
river.
The Mississippi River runs through 10 states and was used to
define portions of these states&apos; borders. The middle of the
riverbed at the time the borders were established was the line to
define the borders between states. The river has since shifted, but
the state borders of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky,
Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi have not changed;  they still
follow the former bed of the Mississippi River as of their
establishment. The source of the Mississippi River is Lake Itasca,
1,475 ft above sea level in Itasca State Park located in Clearwater
County, Minnesota.
The uppermost lock and dam on the Mississippi River is the Upper
St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Above the
dam, the river&apos;s elevation is 799 feet. Below the dam, the river&apos;s
elevation is 750 feet. This 49-foot drop is the largest of all the
Mississippi River lock and dams. By the time the river reaches St.
Paul, Minnesota, below Lock and Dam #1, it has dropped more than
half its original elevation and is 687 feet above sea level. From
St. Paul to the Gulf of Mexico the river elevation falls much more
slowly and is controlled and managed as series of pools created by
locks and dams.


The Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico about 100
miles downstream from New Orleans. Measurements of the length of
the Mississippi from Lake Itasca to the Gulf of Mexico vary
somewhat, but the United States Geological Survey&apos;s number is 2,340
miles. The retention time from Lake Itasca to the Gulf is about 90
days. The Mississippi River discharges at an annual average rate of
between 200,000 and 700,000 cubic ft/s. On average, the Mississippi
has only 9% the flow of the Amazon River but is nearly twice that
of the Columbia River and almost 6 times the volume of the Colorado
River.
Many of the works of Mark Twain deal with or take place near the
Mississippi River. One of his first major works, Life on the
Mississippi, is in part a history of the river, in part a memoir of
Twain&apos;s experiences on the river, and a collection of tales that
either take place on or are associated with the river. Twain&apos;s most
famous work, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is largely a journey
down the river.
The Mississippi River probably has more nicknames than any other
river. Mississippi means &quot;large river&quot; to the Chippewa Indians. It
is called Big Muddy (also commonly used for the Missouri), Big
River, Body of a Nation, El Grande, El Grande de Soto, the Father
of Waters, the Gathering of Waters, the Great River, the Mighty
Mississippi, the Muddy Mississippi, Old Man River, etc. This
Earthcache is dedicated with much love to my dad, John Haslock, for
knowing all of those nicknames &amp;amp;  for taking me to Cairo,
Illnois when I was young - even if I didn&apos;t even undertsand then
why he chose such an odd place to go on vacation. I am still not
sure why we drove a couple hundred extra miles to visit an old
slave house, but, besides my dad having some similarities to Clark
Grizwold, I am sure that destination had a purpose as well.

2009-10-11 Kurt Franke, Found it, 2 of 7 today, cache 2289.

In the Saint Louis area so my mother could attend a wedding. I took the opportunity to visit my brother, ride my bike and geocache. Spent lots of time with virtuals and Earthcaches, a real self-guided tour. Had a blast.

This earthcache was one of my goals for the weekend. I new I wanted to spend some time riding my bike and Eathcaching. The trials and the Mississippi River go well together. Abit of a sketchy time riding my road bike the last quarter mile into the site. No problem. Had just come off the Chain of Rocks Bridge so I had all the confirmation information I needed. Now for a photo and a view.

Thanks for the Earthcache. They are my favorite.

090 09.DEF

A - Add up the Number of letters and #&apos;s combined, on the line of the tombstone representing his Birth
B - the last # in the Year of death
C - His height in Feet minus 4
D - Two words at bottom of tombstone -  # of letters minus 3
E - 2 numbers for actual DAY of birth: add them + 1
F - Month of his birth is this #

Enjoy the cache and post pictures if you get the chance. Small round lock &amp; pop container that&apos;s camo&apos;d. Will hold small items.

Congrats on the FTF awanderer, sneakygeogirl and bigskykevin!!

2008-12-27 graciedi, Let me start by saying we made this much more difficult than it had to be.  We did not know there was a road back there nor did we know this cemetery existed.  So, we tried it from one angle walking in and only succeeded in scaring up a herd of deer.  That made it worthwhile watching their white tails scurry away.  Then we drove around and ended up crossing a creek and climbing up the hill to the cemetery.  Got our exercise in but were a little ticked when we saw the road.  The cache was worth the work.  Got a good chuckle, took a picture for 4HGal&apos;s husband to see,  signed the log, and walked out the easy way.  Thanks for another unique cache.

But we had some issues with flooding preventing us from getting to caches, too many DNFs, lots of fun, and OK (windy with sprinkles) weather.  Ended up with about 50 finds for the day (and 14 DNFs ouch! Bridges drove us crazy today).  Thanks for lots of great caches and challenges.

I am sure this is not where the owner cached it so I returned it to a location more appropiate than the ground, but I am unsure if the location is where its owner intended.

 <desc>Lawrence County First Night Cache by king-of-halloween
Cache ID: GC1K6VX
Unknown Cache
SIZE: Regular
D3.5/T4.0
DESC: ONLY EXTREME HARDCORE CACHERS Should attempt this!!  Not a Friendly cache!  NO SANDALS, SHORTS, SHORT SLEEVES!!  NOT WHEEL CHAIR ACCESSIBLE and NOT KID OR STROLLER FRIENDLY!!!
11-08-09  update......Wow!!!!!!!!!!!   I walked this 3 times last night and everytime I walked it I took the directions that it showed me and I came up with alot quicker route and ALOT less painful.  I dont know what happened during the Summer to make this cache easier but it did..   Be warned if you see a big arrow in a fallen tree ,you are on the long path, but end in the same place anyhow.
  Be also advised that SOME of the markers can only be seen if you are standing right next to the last one you found. Some take some stooping down looking but none is  where you would have to climb to see your next one.

  Have fun and put in your log  if you went the long way or short.



The above coords are the parking coords!  You should find yourself in a small parking area!  You will need to WALK TO THE BEGINNING COORDS:  N 38&apos;43.621  W087&apos; 50.399
Once again I stress this is NOT for the WEAK or WEARY or CHILDREN!  It is not a sandal, short friendly cache.  IT simply is NOT a friendly cache at all!

The PARK HOURS are 6AM to 11PM.  (please abide by the park rules)

Notice on Geocache web site must state the following information:
1. Geocache is placed on Department managed property with permission.
2. Do not place the following items in the Geocache: Food items,inappropriate,offensive, or hazardous materials.
3. It is the visitors responsibility or orient themselves with policies and rules pertaining to this Department managed site. 

This cache was placed over 1 year ago.  I have rewalked this several times since placing it and the shortest time I walked it was 50 minutes from start to stop.  The cache could be even more difficult and probably almost impossible to do during the spring and summer once the foilage takes over the trees!!!  
  
  I was talking to STP10 about placing a night cache at RHSP and he offered to help me find a location.  Now if you have ever done any of STP10&apos;s caches, you probably have noticed that he particularly likes to place them in briars and other sticky things!  
  We tied a strap to our waists and he led the way!  We started at the beginning coords and off we went!  Everytime I fell I marked a waypoint as he was dragging me up, down, under and over obstacles, through water and mud on our journey to find a good final location.  I thought it was over and the away we went again.
  I am sorry to say that you will probably encounter two frowney faces before you find the smiley you are looking for!  I might even have to give you some direction along the way. You will know when you get to the final location.  Just remember that you do have your parking coordinates in your gps in case you need to figure out how to get back to your car!  My recommendations of items to have with you on this journey include mud boots, long sleeve shirt, at least 2 good flashlights, a cell phone, at least a 2nd person (or someone that is in knowledge where you will be), a box of bandaids or a first aid kit (thanks to SPT10).
  I walked this at night using a 6D LED flashlight and a 6volt cheap flashlight.  I was unable to see some of the markers with my 6D LED but used the cheapo 6volt for those and could see them ok! Most places you will need to stand next to the marker in order to spot the next one.  (I must have fell down alot of times during the initial journey!!!)  Depending on the time of year when you do this one, you may encounter wild life, thorns, poison plants, snakes and alot of water or mud!  
  The terrain is rated a 4 due to it being a night cache and needing to use a flashlight to see where you are walking.  It could be a 3 or 3.5 during daylight!  However, if attempted during the daylight the difficulty could change to a higher rating as the reflectors will be more difficult to see.  
 You will know when you get to the final location.  You will find a clear plastic container with a few nice FTF prizes.  Take your pick!!!

Hint: Pack extra batteries and a second flashlight!!!

2009-03-28 seabee89, 11BINF and myself decided to tackle this one tonight;  we decided when the sun was out without looking too hard at the weather...learned a new lesson there!  He wanted to find a cache that he missed while it was still light out, so we started, and the rain started.  It was a downpour that SLOWLY tapered to a steady rain.  
We didn&apos;t find the one he wanted, but once it got dark, we started looking for the night cache.  Once we started, it took just over 37 minutes to find it.  You have the terrain dead-on!  bring a snorkle and first aid kit.  Eat well before you go!  
I loved it.  Best cache ever.  I am soaked, cold, muddy, and plan to do it again soon (note to self:  wait until November).  Thanks, King.  Gave me an idea....

2009-03-17 A&amp;M62460, Out caching with afroehle.  It was a great evening for a night cache.  We grabbed my LED flashlight and my 18V Ryobi flashlight.  After spotting the first marker we were on our way.  After starting the walk I said to afroehle that this might not be that bad at all, but about 5 seconds later our path made a turn and the hike really got interesting.  After two frowny faces my cell rang;  it was the king, he asked if we were cursing him yet.  I think I only cursed a few times as the briars brought me to a halt and I stumbled over some branches.  We were stalled at one point for a minute but spotted the way.  Then a while later we finally found a smiley.  We completed the cache in about 50-55 minutes.  We took nothing but left a A&amp;M62460 signature wood coin and signed the log.  We walked out of the woods with smiles on our faces, some battle scars, and a lot of mud on our shoes.  Thanks king for the great cache and a lot of fun.  TFTC.

2009-01-05 king-of-halloween, Congrats go out to Mike Anderson 1492 and Whistlin in the Dark for a FTF!!!!!!!    You earned it!!
Found it
2009-01-05 mike_anderson1492, Geeez!  What can I say?  Whistlin&apos; and I talked about being FTF on this one so, since it was a very overcast day, we decided to take it on.  We started way too early and that increased the difficulty level a bunch.  By the time we found it (2+ hours later) we were muddy, bruised, battered, bleeding and worn out.  But we found it.  FTF!
The FTF prize we took was Laser LED Light.  That will really come in handy on future night caches.  NOT!  The 18V rechargeable flashlight I carried really lit up the area (when it finally became dark enough).  If you try this one with a little wimpy flashlight you will probably not find the container.  You might not need to purchase a 1,000,000 candle power flashlight light for this cache but if you have one bring it along.
Thanks for the hunt (I think).  
 P.S.  If you want a PAF hint on this one, forget it!  You need to work for this to enjoy it!

2009-11-01 peanutsdad, I have been putting this cache off since I returned from South Taxes last March.  Today as the day with
no road construction to day, I donned my bib overalls, gum boots and started down the road, but parking was still a problem, until I figured out there is a drive way going down into the bottoms on the north side of the road on the east end of the bridge.  After a bit I just went and sign the log.  I took the TB that had been placed there in may and left it on the bridge banister, and it would still be there, if I had not remembered taking it after I got home. And whereupon not finding it in a pocket of my bib overhauls, I put my gum boots back on and went back, I could see it laying there before I even got close, the sun was just shining off of it. TFTC

2009-09-12 8ight, This great hide has a total of 13 finds in the 9 months it&apos;s been active.  The 1 star hide just down the road has 40 finds in the last 12 months it&apos;s been active.  He Shoots, He Scores has an average of 1.4 finds a month compared to 1 star down the road that gets almost 2 more finds a month (3.3 total) on average.  There have been 12 people find the 1 star hide since the last &quot;Found It&quot; log entry found here.

Someone put a lot of time, effort, and money into a fantastic hide here and the keybox down the road gets hit like mad while this one gets skipped over.  Skipped over because it&apos;s rated so high?  I guess so.  It&apos;s all about easy numbers to most of you which sucks the fun out of putting together something unique and fun.

This cache is in memory of the school year days when my friends and I would long for the big snow storm, when school would be canceled. We would spend hours on end trucking up this hill, just for the few seconds of riding down. There used to be an old concrete dam that would block the nearby creek.  Since then, the village has &quot;improved&quot; but at the cost of old landmarks now lost to memory.

2009-07-10 BlueBeadMan, Pyro_cat was giving props to Willie Wonka (literally), or at least practicing to do so, so 2_cats and myself decided to find some caches while the 15 year old rehearsed.  We didn&apos;t find too many, but we picked up at few in the Alton area.  This was one of our cache finds.  I guess you could say we were practicing for tomorrow&apos;s summer picnic and road rally.  We NEED a lot of practice!  Thanks!  [:)]  TNLNSL--Thanks again for the cache!

2009-06-06 CribbageWitch, OCW Hobbit Taz on a lovely mild, breezy June afternoon.  It was much to nice to be indoors and yet after several weeks of crowds, we were not looking for areas where we would fight for parking or stand in a line.  I think we picked some out-of-the-way caches that filled out needs.  Boy, this was a tight squeeze.  I hid the hide a little better as it was neon when I spied it.  TFTC

2009-05-02 Hobbit Taz, After finishing the S&apos;N&apos;L Series I still had some daylight left so figured on working on some Alton caches.  
I headed up to this one and located a place to park the car and walked the road side to where I thought I saw a path heading into the woods.  Im not sure what or who made this path since it was well worn but it was like crawling into a rabbit hole - had to really duck down to get inside the woods and even then had to push branches away.  Once inside it wasnt too bad.  I recalled the clue and and spotted this like a camera flashing.  Hello there...  Signed and back out - where did i put that mushroom - I need to get back out that rabbit hole....
Thanks for the view into your memories of the area.  


Out Caching by myself since CribbageWitch was out of town this weekend. I had a TB that wanted to visit military bases and since i was heading sort of south for the WWFM today decided to Start with Jefferson Barracks and make my way back to the WWFM at noon and then on to St. Charles county S&apos;N&apos;L series that CribbageWitch had already done. 
Ended up the day with 28 caches - not bad for the distances traveled.

DESC: This cache is located in the eastbound I-70 rest area. Hidden in the woods some bushwacking maybe required.
You will be looking for a small red water proof container. Contents are a log book. There is enough room to hold small trackables like geocoins. 

This is a really large rest area. Muggles should not be a problem.  I was suprised there was not a cache already here and thought it needed one.

Ticks, chiggers, poison ivy, and sticker bushes may all be present.

2009-10-30 beejay&amp;esskay, OK, it&apos;s pouring rain.  The cache is 500 ft into the bush.  But if I take the quick LPCs it seems I shouldn&apos;t skip some harder rest area caches.  Ticks and chiggers seem to be hiding from the rain.  Didn&apos;t see any poison ivy but I guess I&apos;ll find out in a few days.  I did manage to run into some sticker bushes.  But the coordinates led me straight to the cache it was easy to spot when I got there.  It&apos;s a 70-mile drive to my next cache...maybe I&apos;ll be dry by then.

2009-09-05 JonesCrew, 3/5 of the JonesCrew attended the fun Moonshine event today with Flatkatz and Pika Wants Cake. We had a great trip! Cached a little on our way to Effingham (what is up with that smell there), saw a fire breathing dragon, cached on our way to Moonshine, and then cached again after the event. We hit the big milestone of 1,000 finds FINALLY! We also got a new high finds for the day of 51 caches (please note that is ONE MORE than Flatkatz---but I am sure he will break our record soon)! We visited some interesting places...most of them seemed to be cemeteries which was a tad creepy since our group caching name was Team Damned for (D.David A.Arleen M.Mariel. N.nothing E.Emily D.Dale)  as Dave pointed out in his log. 

All in all it was a great day and it ended with a great meal at Cracker Barrel in Effingham and more SLAGA members somehow found us and joined us!

 We had a great time of course, and ended up with 38 caches. We spent most of the afternoon caching with mikeinmo, Donut Girl, and the LFranks and some other SLAGA cachers. signing logs as Team SLAGA 1 or some variations of that.

After driving through lots of rain, we finally got ahead of the front and pulled into the rest area for a break &amp; a cache. I saw mikeinmo&apos;s car parked in front, and we met up with them near the cache. We were told the better way to walk into this one, we had a nice easy walk to an easy find. Thanks kstrucker,

DESC: On 1/07/05 my fishing &quot;buddy&quot; passed away.  He was more than a fishing buddy, he was part of the family, a father figure, and a mentor to my niece. He was buried here on a cold January day and I thought I&apos;d dedicate a cache to him on the anniversary of his death.  Truth be known, he wouldn&apos;t be very happy about being here.  His wishes were to be cremated and his ashes spread over his favorite fishing hole.  Sorry, buddy, but I&apos;m sure your spirit is there.
Cache is small and holds log only.  BYOP.  Should be a quick and easy find.  There&apos;s only one place it could really be.

If you look across the highway, you&apos;ll see where me and my brother and sisters went to grade school (Big Prairie School).  They tore it down several years ago but I still see it as I drive by.

DESC: This cache is located at Old River which is the favorite fishing spot for me and my fishing &quot;buddy&quot;.  Cache is small and a creation of mine so I&apos;m not sure how it&apos;s going to hold up.  Be careful when opening to remove the log as it could be easily broken.  I&apos;ll keep an eye on it and try to make one sturdier if need be.  Log only, BYOP.
Before caching became my obsession, I spent all my spare time fishing with my mom and &quot;Buddy&quot;.  This was our favorite place to fish.  I spent countless hours (days, really) sitting in the Bass Tracker with Buddy and mom.  The great thing about Old River is you never know what kind of fish you&apos;re going to pull out of there.  My favorite are crappie and there are some monsters here.  The biggest catfish I ever caught was from this muddy water.  There&apos;s also a lot of gar and perch (lip fish as I called them) but you take the good with the bad.  Buddy used to get such a kick out of me when I&apos;d catch a fish because I get a little excited - kind of like when I find a cache only it&apos;s harder to do a happy dance in a boat.  I think Buddy would have loved caching if he&apos;d got the chance.

Keep in mind this area floods when the river is up and road back to cache will be under water at times.  Road could be muddy for a while after water&apos;s gone down.  There is a place big enough to turn geo-mobile around about an 1/8 of a mile past cache.

DESC: This is a micro in one of Greenville&apos;s parks.  It is easy to walk up to.
This is located by the outdoor swimming pool, so you might need to be stealthy when finding the cache.  When the pool season is not happening, it is a pretty quiet place.  But in the summer, you may have to wait until the pool is closed to come, so that there won&apos;t be any muggles.  

The pool hours for the summer are from Noon - 5 pm during the week with some additional open hours on weekends.

Enjoy the cache and remember to be stealthy!!!

In June of 2008, torrential rains fell in Jasper County just to the north.  The resulting 10+ inches of water channeled into the tributaires leading to the Embarras River (pronounced Ambraw), causing it to swell and overtop the levees.  Dozens of breaches occured and levees broke causing the largest flooding event remembered.  Water from the river backed up all the way to the Calfkiller Creek bridge just East of the cache.  This bridge is over 4 miles from the river.  Although I don&apos;t know how the Calfkiller Creek got its name, I do know that this flood of 2008 swept away several caches in the area!

*Note*  There is a parking area right off the highway north of signs.  I do mean right off the highway so be very careful about the traffic.

2009-05-16 Gerhardus, Left the St. Louis area early this morning to cache a dense bunch of caches we kept talking about South of HWY 64!  We finally set a date and made the two hour journey.  We were not disapointed despite 14 DNF&apos;s.  Thanks for the fun day in your neck of the woods.  We stopped in a bunch of these today.  Thanks again.

SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T4.0
DESC: If the original contents of cache container were let loose, this is a small taste of what things might look like afterwards.  Be very careful as you try to get to cache - terrain will require some climbing around.
Cache is larger than an ammo box and contains small items to trade.  Be careful as you sign the log to make sure no one sees you.  Pen is enclosed in the cache - you shouldn&apos;t have trouble finding it.  

High muggle area as cache is near a busy highway.  Use stealth.

Prize for FTF.

SIZE: Micro
D2.5/T1.5
DESC: This is a multi cache.  The coordinates take you to the first cache...a pill bottle.  From the first cache, you will be led around the church grounds until you find the final.  It may be helpful to bring a pencil and paper with you.  Benchmark JB1614 is also in the area.
This area, known as Grand Prairie, was settled in the 1840s by German and Swiss immigrants.  Much of the current congregation are decendants from those who emmigrated from the old country.  The first church building was erected in 1852.  It was struck by lightening about 100 years later and burned to the ground.  The bell, which was from Switzerland, survived and is in the bell tower today.  German was the prominant language in the area and services were still held in German until the late 1910s.  The switch to English spoken services remained permanent.

2009-10-18 L Frank, Denmother and I were OCW Strider, Crowesfeat30, and quailman2 after Cache Slash Fest. Even though there were a lot of DNFs, we heard that it had been repaired. We decided to do this one since we were in the area. Had a lot of fun. The 6 of us made a race out of it from waypoint to waypoint. The final was in good shape. Signed as SLAGA 6.

2009-10-10 Hunts with Wine, I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve ever had this many DNF&apos;s since we started caching.  We found the film can lid on the ground with little bite marks on it and then found the culprit.  OH! He was so cute!  There is a little mouse that is living a hole in the tree about waist high on the Southwest side of the tree.  We do not think that the cache was hidden in his hole because the name &quot;shimmy, shimmy&quot; made you think that it was hidden higher up.  However, we are picturing him climbing up the tree pushing it out of its hiding place over and over because of the logs we&apos;ve read.  We never did find the canister but I did climb pretty high up looking for any clues as to where it might have been hidden. Farewell, little buddy. Sorry to bother you.
Found it
2009-09-23 dusty and kate, Not sure what to think about this cache. It was on the ground (again) and the lid was. The container wasn&apos;t a pill bottle but a film container that had been chewed on on buy something small. The log was plenty dry so I signed it and hid it back again. The last entry I saw was from May 17th.

Cache ID: GC1M3BN
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D1.0/T3.0
DESC: I like the grab and go caches.  These type of caches are easy to hide, easier to find, and provide the caching fix for the caching enthusiast and/or the out-of-town traveler on the highway.  The cache is located a VERY short distance from where you will park your car, but the hill is somewhat steep.  This makes this cache definitely not wheelchair accessible.
Cereal Saturday?  I had never heard of this before, but this day lives in the mind of my high school teenager, Travis.  He lives for this day.  This means, the day is obviously a Saturday.  He doesn&apos;t have to set an alarm to get out of bed, and doesn&apos;t have to do much when he gets up.  More imporantly, he can eat bowl after bowl of cereal;  something he can&apos;t do during the week because he has to go to school.  Being able to sit and gorge himself on this sugary treat is something that must give pure pleasure, at least in his world.  I have given this cache the name, because he didn&apos;t want to get out of the house and hide caches with me today!  It was Cereal Saturday!! :)

The cache is located on the South Outer Road, along Interstate 55.  Please take the exit for Highway &quot;O&quot;, and head for the outer road.  It&apos;s located about a mile, give or take, on the left hand side of the road.  It is located near a cedar grove.  

The cache itself is one of the infamous &quot;JohnTee&quot; ready-to-go micro&apos;s.  Some call them &quot;baby soda bottles&quot;, some call them preforms.  I have camoed it a bit, but this is definitely NOT hard to find, even for the novice cacher.  The cache contains only a log book and a pencil.  Please, no notes on the log;  only signatures.  I like reading the notes, so please put them in an email.  Thanks for looking.

Cached a little on our way to Effingham (what is up with that smell there), saw a fire breathing dragon, cached on our way to Moonshine, and then cached again after the event. We hit the big milestone of 1,000 finds FINALLY! We also got a new high finds for the day of 51 caches (please note that is ONE MORE than Flatkatz---but I am sure he will break our record soon)! We visited some interesting places...most of them seemed to be cemeteries which was a tad creepy since our group caching name was Team Damned for (D.David A.Arleen M.Mariel. N.nothing E.Emily D.Dale)  as Dave pointed out in his log. 

All in all it was a great day and it ended with a great meal at Cracker Barrel in Effingham and more SLAGA members somehow found us and joined us!

We had an absolute blast out here and enjoyed all the caches! [:D]  We signed the logs as either: Slaga Slackers, Team DDam, Team Damd, or Team Damned.  The name progressed as we cached more and more cemeteries.  TNLNSL  TFTC!!!!

D.David A.Arleen M.Mariel. N.nothing E.Emily D.Dale. We just could not resist the Team Damned especially considering how many cemetery caches we started doing. It was especially enjoyable when we started having vultures and dead things around. It really gave our name that much more significance.

2009-11-05 CribbageWitch, SLAGA County Challenge

Out caching to grab some of the Illinois counties on the SLAGA Challenge. It took a bit to spy this one and I had forgotten my writing tool at the broom. When I got the log signed and turned to replace it, I was greeted by two friendly dogs and they excorted me back to the hide. When the container was back in place one of the dogs felt compelled to pee on my tire before he went on his way.

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4917. (54 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

I kind of goofed on this one, it is not really a multi cache because there is only one cache container, but cant change the type of cache it is after it was posted.

 <desc>Phillips Corner by SidewaysSam
Cache ID: GC1MEBC
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D1.0/T2.0
DESC: Watch our for the thorns.
The brick home to the north is known as the Phillips House.  Built between 1861-1863, it is one of 4 structures that was built in that time period using clay dug from nearby hillsides.  A home about a mile southeast, a home about 7 miles southeast, and the old Dundas School (no longer standing) were the other three.  Bricks were made by a brick company in Dundas at the time.  On the southeast corner of the home you might notice a pipe projecting form the second story.  There used to be a windmill in the front yard which would pump water up to a holding tank in the corner of the second floor room.  The water could then be turned on and off in the kitchen below.  It is thought that this was the first home with running water in the county.  The Phillips family owned the home for nearly 120 years.  Local legend has it that one time owner George Phillips, who committed suicide inside, still haunts the rooms of the house.

D1.0/T1.0
DESC: This magnetic micro is close to the Lyman Trumbull House which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
You are looking for a micro cache that&apos;s basically a grab n&apos; go. A small pencil and log are in the container. This cache is placed just to the South of the historic Lyman Trumbull House. It&apos;s the white house just across the bushes. Lyman Trumbull and his Family lived in this house from 1849 to 1863. He served as a US Senator from Illinois from 1855 till 1873. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee he co-authored and lead the fight for passage of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution, which prohibited slavery in the United States. Trumbull supported Abraham Lincoln on many issues and helped him in his unsuccesful 1858 Senate Race and in his victorious bid for Presidency in 1860.

This area is in the heart of Alton&apos;s beginnings - called Midtown - so there are many large antebellum homes surrounding this...

No need to disturb the bushes to the north of the sidewalk. You can almost touch this one from the car.

CONGRATS to the A B S team - on the FTF!!
Hint: NO PARKING - from here to corner

2009-09-11 Mama Jane, Read the logs about the big dog, I am not a fan of dogs big or small, so I left the door open just in case I needed to get in fast.  I think I was so busy looking for the dog that I couldn&apos;t see the cache, hubby came up with it and we never did see the dog.  tftc

2009-06-07 dusty and kate, We were out in the new red geo-convertible doing some cahing on a wonderful afternoon. As we pulled up to the cemetary two young kids came running over from the church and began askng a hundred questions;  &quot;what are you doing&quot; &quot;why are you looking at tombstones&quot;, etc. Then their mom called them back to the church. Before the young boy left, he looked at my car with the top down, and asked my wife &quot;Why do you drive a broken car?&quot;  That one will give a lot of laughs!

2009-05-26 bryan.ackerman1, well i have erased the log a few times and explained to that guy why he shouldnt have posted it  but apparently he is either stupid or just wants to stick his nose where it doesnt belong  but for the final record this geocache is in no way responsible for any damage to anything  the pole leaned way b4 it was ever hidden. what gracidi was describing in her log was that the pole started to sway on her so she appologised to me for not replacing my cache where she found it  not for damaging anything i guess there is always gonna be that guy who throws out his opion without any fact

2009-05-16 myotis, OCW Gerhardus and Lancelot-our first DNF of the day. Well we found it but could not get it-particularly without risking damaging the pole more. How did you ever get the owner of the cemetery to give you permission to put a cache there????? I would think they would be too concerned about damaging the pole or getting sued if someone got hurt to give permission. Heck I am surprised you placed one in a place like that-I would be afraid of getting sued for creating an attractive nuences or the cemetery asking me to pay for the damage that has been done to the pole. The previous cacher mentioned they bent the pole when they put it back. We observed the damage. I hope you are going to fix it.

2009-03-14 graciedi, Well, Bryan, I know you didn&apos;t expect these girls to get this one (4HGal and I) and feel free to check the log to make sure (it&apos;s signed in  purple ink with the pen I lifted from Solarwib this morning).  Goes to show you don&apos;t have to be in great shape to get it - just smarter than the cache.  Here&apos;s how it went:  I stood on top of 4HGal&apos;s shoulders but still couldn&apos;t reach it. Even with the help of my elderly neighbor&apos;s reacher, I couldn&apos;t get it.  Had to do the shimmy, shimmy thing and got it.  Putting it back was a little more difficult as the pole began to bend - sorry for that.  Got it back to within 6 - 8 inches of original location.  Hope you enjoyed this mental picture brought to you by graciedi &amp; 4HGal.  Laughed all the way back to home base.  Thanks for the fun.

This cache is a multi.  The coordinates listed above is the location for the first part of the multi.  At this point you will need to find the coordinates for the 2nd part in order to finish this 2 stage multi.  You do not need to go on private property to get the first stage.  It is approximately 10 miles from point A to point B. At the 2nd location there will be an ammo can with a log book and trade items. We have the difficulty at a 3 because we personally have never seen a cache of this type before.  We hope you find this to be a great cache.

2009-08-15 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter (sometimes logging as “MG/TR/RO” for brevity) between Salem, IL and Vincennes, IN on Hwy 50. We didn&apos;t know that the waypoint for this cache was almost in a cacher&apos;s front yard, but XRAYGRL asked us “Are y&apos;all geocaching?” when she spotted us and then introductions were made and some geocaching yarns were told. I found the final pretty quickly, once we got to that location later in our route. TNLNSL. Thanks, king-of-halloween, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

2009-08-15 Mean Gene, Caching with Roelsch along US-50 on a warm but pleasant day central Illinois.

I thought this would be easy but I could not find it so I thought I would check some other places that looked good and there it was. Thanks

2009-11-25 MSalisbury, Found with Railroading while traveling north to visit family during the Thanksgiving holiday.  I grew up in nearby Albion, until moving away in 1973.  My family still has property in the area.  My grandparents lived in Fairfield, my father had his medical practice in Mt. Carmel, and I remember when the main road used to swing through Browns.   I had hoped to find a cache in Albion, but this one will do.  This one took a little bit of searching to find the road leading to this site, and then I had to wrassle with the thorn bushes before Railroading convinced me that I was on the wrong track.  But after stepping back and getting a cross-bearing we soon had the cache in hand and signed.  TFTH!

DESC: I&apos;m in complete agreement with King of Halloween.  If you don&apos;t want to hunt for a cache on an army tank, plant one there yourself.  Better you looking for this than me.
Cache is located in city park in Grayville.  On nice days, there will be muggles everywhere.  I used to bring my niece and nephew here to climb all over this tank when they were little.  Now they can come search it for the cache.  Hope it brings back as many memories for them as it did for me.  

Cache is small camo covered container about the size of a film canister.

2009-06-20 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on a warm late spring day, hot enough to qualify for summertime, in the Collinsville, Glen Carbon and Edwardsville area of Madison County. We parked at the designation location and started heading for the highway. We got to GZ and looked all around the cache location but didn&apos;t spot the container, so we moved on to [i]Poole Party 11[/i], hoping to get a sense of for what container we might be looking. 

When we came back, Mean Gene spotted this one in less than 30 seconds. TNLNSL. Thanks, eileen.poole, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

D3.0/T2.0
DESC: The cache is not at the above coordinates.

Solve the puzzle to find the final coordinates.
As a full time worker, I don?t often get time to go a cache for many days in a row.  However, I decided to take five days off and go get several caches.  I decided to look for caches placed by five different geocachers (including Doc_Funk), each on a different day.  Each geocacher hid a different type of cache container (one is a Lock-N-Lock).  Each cache had been hidden for a different amount of time, so each contained a different number of log entries (6, 7, 8, 9, or 10).  From the information provided, determine the day on which I found the cache, who hid the cache and the number of log entries in the cache when I found it.
1.	 The log for Tsnake?s cache, a Bison Tube, contained 9 entries.
2.	The log for Gabbers? cache contained 3 fewer entries than the cache I found on the 2nd day.
3.	I found the 35mm canister exactly two days after I found the cache hidden by Little T.  I found Pharmgal?s cache on the 1st day.
4.	The log from Little T?s cache contained 1 more log than the Nano cache.
5.	The log for Pharmgal?s cache contained exactly 4 more entries as the cache I found on the 4th day.
6.	I didn?t find the Ammo Box on the 3rd day.

The cache is at:	 N38° 46.[Logs of cache on 2nd Day][Day of Ammon Box Cache][Logs in Gabbers? Cache]?
	W089° 57.[Logs in Doc_Funk?s Cache][Logs of cache on 3rd day][Day on Nano Cache]?

2009-07-03 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter (signing the logs as “MG/TR/RO”) in the Edwardsville area on a delightfully temperate summer&apos;s day, the start of the Independence Day weekend. We made this one into more of an adventure than it was supposed to be. 

Mean Gene solved the puzzle last week and I confirmed his answer, so we were reasonably sure we knew where we were going. We walked down the [i]biking[/i] trail just east of the park until we got near the cache coordinates and saw that pretty much we &quot;couldn&apos;t get there from here&quot;. We partially retraced our steps, went back into the park, and walked down the [i]hiking[/i] trail inside the park and were much more successful in finding the right location and the cache in a place that fit the hint.

Nedward &quot;Ned&quot; Flanders is a recurring fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Harry Shearer, and first appeared in the series premiere episode &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;. He is the next door neighbor to the Simpson family and is generally loathed by Homer Simpson. A devout and sometimes overbearing Christian, he is nonetheless amongst the most friendly and compassionate Springfieldians and is generally considered a pillar of the Springfield community.

He was one of the first characters outside of the immediate Simpson family to appear on the show, and has since been central to several episodes, the first being season two&apos;s &quot;Dead Putting Society&quot;. His last name comes from Flanders St. in Portland, Oregon, the hometown of Simpsons creator Matt Groening. When he was created, he was intended to just be a neighbor that was very nice, but Homer loathed.

near rocks surrounding lake/pond. However, if you do not like
snakes stay away from the rocks.
The cache is
filled with a log, pencil and goodies for kids. It does contain a
FTF prize, which is labeled. In order to get the coordinates you
must FIRST solve the the puzzle below.

Bring your binoculars and bird book and do some birding here.

Left a Hot Wheels and filled in a page in the sticker book.  Did not take the Travel Bug because I didn&apos;t know when I would be able to move it to a good cache for more traveling.

Thanks.

2009-10-12 catdad, OK, I should have read the previous logs before I went to search for this one. I tried every thing I could to search a bit higher than I could reach. At least graciedi&apos;s log will save me from bringing a ladder. I think I know what to look for now and will be back.

2009-04-26 graciedi, First of all, let me say 4HGal and I have been here more than once (okay, 5 or 6 times) and not found it.  We returned today (with step ladder) determined to find it.  We had been given a couple clues (one good, one not so good).  Used our trusty ladder to look in all the obvious places but still came up empty.  We were about to give up and leave - disappointed once again - when a truck pulled up and pinkyandthebrain jumped out.  They apparently enjoyed watching our searching with step ladder - and, once they stopped laughing, took pity on us.  Once shown, don&apos;t know how we missed it (except we were on wrong track - refer back to bad clue).  Must say, this is one of the best ones I&apos;ve ever seen.  Enjoyed talking with pinky and the brain (it&apos;s obvious who the brain is) and really enjoyed the challenge.  More than anything, glad to finally have found this one so I can quit obsessing about it.  Would love to see some more caches of this caliber from pinkyandthebrain.

Cache ID: GC1NXNN
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D4.0/T1.5
DESC: The terrain for this easy. The difficulty is so high because the
area is surrounded by muggles and the cache is pretty tricky
because of the traffic and use. There is a possibility of repeat
attempts because of muggle interference. The park is open from dawn
to dusk.
Cache is located in beautiful Herrin City Park. There is a pond
with ducks, geese and lots of things to do with the kids. The city
pool is also open seasonally. They have shelters with bbq grills
which makes it a great place for picnics. 
This is Herrin&apos;s first micro. FTF gets a special certificate for
their accomplishment. Only room in cache for log and pencil. Thanks
for visiting!

Thought I&apos;d create one to honor rednecks. Don&apos;t think I&apos;m making
fun - there&apos;s a little redneck in all of us. As the song says &quot;you
can&apos;t hide redneck - might as well be proud&quot;. The cache itself is
an item some rednecks will recognize. Surroundings are definitely
redneck country - mud bogs, trailer homes, and American flag. A =
Dale Ernhart&apos;s Nascar number. B = Name of Garth Brooks&apos; CD released
in 1997. C = According to Jeff Foxworthy, you might be a redneck if
your _____ year old can rebuild a carburetor. D = Number of beers
in a six-pack minus the number of comedians on the Blue Collar
Comedy Tour. E = Dale Ernhart Jr&apos;s original Nascar number. F = The
____ of November should be a national holiday according to Big

2009-09-13 myotis, Decided to do some cachinhg today.  I had planned on going much further South and doing lots more caches.  But I liked the first two places I went today (Washington COunty Nature Preserve and Washington County Conservation Area) I spent all day there and just found 3 caches. I had a really great time and got to do some hiking in really nice areas.  I also got to GPS a bunch of stuff for my trail  map.  So thnaks for the outstanding caches!  One thing I liked aobut both places was they are obviously regualarly burned and I did not see many invassive and some very high forest.  I get so tired of seeing the invassive jungles around the STL area.

You are looking for an ammo can.  You will find yourself in a woods.  You should be able to follow a trail most of the way to the cache with just a small bit of bushwacking to the actual location.  Please be AWARE that there are horse riders, 4-wheelers and paintball wars that take place in this woods.  The paintball wars generally are to the south end of the woods.  Permission was granted by Gary &amp; Susan, who live just south of the woods.  Please be courteous to the area.  If you had done the Lawrence County Multi Mystery, this was the final location to complete it.  It has been archived now so I replaced this location with another cache.  So for those that did find the final location this is in the same location.

DESC: This is my first of hopefully several video game realated caches. This is gonna be a bit of a challenge (hopefully) so be prepared to jump into the world of video games! Take note that when entering the &quot;lost woods&quot; look for deer trails, makes the search go much smoother if your not fighting brush. Also if you choose choice #2 I have a little hint for you... Wiki is your friend!
As Link fought his way through the many dangers of Hyrule it became apparent that it was time to upgrade his white sword and obtain the mythical magic sword (cache). He knew there was only one place to go to locate this new more powerful sword. As Link stands before the cemetary he knows he has to make one of two choices to obtain this new weapon (cache).

Choice #1: Go to the grave that leads to the secret passage to the magic sword, once at that grave walk East to the cemetary edge. It will be there, you will search for a micro container that contains the coordinates to the infamous magic sword (cache). The container is small and camo, good luck!

Choice #2: Answer the following questions to get the answers to the coordinates.

A) In what year did the The Legend of Zelda win the &quot;Best Challenge&quot; award? XXX_

B) The Legend of Zelda was a bestseller for Nintendo, selling how many million copies X._

C) In what issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly did The Legend of Zelda come in 5th place? _XX

D) The Legend of Zelda was realeased on the NES in what year? XX_X

E) In what year did The Legend of Zelda become the second NES game to sell 1 million copies? X_XX

In honor of the game Tecmo Bowl for the NES I decided to host a little football game. Tecmo Bowl was a great football game for the NES and was considered to be the first NFL game for the console. It was way before the days of Madden therefore your choices for plays was very limited. Your choices was up,down,left, and right. The A button and B button determined if the play was passing or running. SO with that being said the game has started, the ball is now in play. Your goal is to score a touchdown on me. I have several waypoints that are listed. All contain a micro container that define what happens as we play this fun little game of football. ONLY 1 of the 6 points contain the touchdown coordinates. Good Luck!

2009-08-02 Gubbie, I was in Carlyle camping this weekend so I decided to try this one once again.  I emailed the owner asking him to verify that it was there at least.  I got no response.  I then emailed Al &amp; Mylea who are the only ones to find it.  They told me where I could find the container with the final coordinates, which was the first location I looked the first time I was out here.  That container is not there.  Kid Dylan and I looked there for at least a half hour when we came out not to mention the hour I spent before.  Al &amp; Mylea also gave me the final coordinates.  They said that the coordinates that were in the container were about 60 feet off.  But those coordinates were updated with the ones they took when they found the final.  Anyway, the coordinates they gave me put me on the banks of a &quot;Sewage Disposal Pond&quot; as the topo map puts it.  And yes, that is what it is.  Obviously, the pond is fenced in and place people shouldn&apos;t go.  So, I looked in all the places on the outside of the fence where the cache could be within 100 feet and found nothing.  After that, I gave it a chance and looked by the pond and didn&apos;t find anything.  

I hate to write bad comments about caches that I haven&apos;t found but this one has some major problems with it.  It seems like the owner doesn&apos;t care since this one hasn&apos;t been checked on and another one of his caches has been disabled for months now.  This is a nice park that should have a regular geocache.  I hope this gets straightened out or just archived so someone else can put a cache here.

2009-06-07 Gubbie, Well, I was out at Carlyle camping so I decided to come over and try this one.  I guess I didn&apos;t blow the dust out of the cartridge before putting it into the NES.   I found 4 of the 6 parts.  &quot;Incomplete Pass&quot;, &quot;Interception&quot;, &quot;Offsides&quot; and &quot;Fumble?&quot;  Of course, I didn&apos;t find the touchdown.  The &quot;Fumble&quot; location was a little tricky with a bird&apos;s nest real close.  After looking for about an hour and a half I started looking for a spot to find a regular size cache.  I didn&apos;t find anything.    I was always better at Contra.  After a couple months, I am wondering if they are still there. I am still wondering what the coordinates at the top of the page are for since it is in the middle of someone&apos;s backyard.  But I will be camping again in 2 weeks.  I will give it another try.

DESC: Thanks
to jcurtis55 for beginning the tour in

Indiana GC1E0K7. Here&apos;s the western continuation of the
National Road Challenge.


      
?OLD NATIONAL ROAD?






?THE HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL
ROAD?

The National Road was first known as the Cumberland Road. It began
when President Thomas Jefferson signed legislation in 1806 allowing
commission to study the feasibility of constructing a road from
Cumberland, Maryland to the Ohio River in order to connect the east
coast to the western frontier and to pass through each state and
territorial capital along the way. This became ?the road that built
a nation? carrying goods, mail, and settlers by wagon across six
states: Maryland, Pennsylvania, and what became West Virginia,
Ohio, Indiana, and Illiniois. Joseph Schriever started surveying
the Illinois section in 1828. William C. Greenup supervised
construction which began in 1830 and by 1836 the road had reached
Vandalia, the Illinois capitol. The project lost its funding in
1838 as proponents were divided as to whether the road should
continue to Alton or St. Louis and within 20 years the National
Road became a secondary method of transportation due to the success
of railroads. Thanks to the popularity of the automobile, the need
of a multi-state paved road was needed and Route 40 following the
original National Road became the major thoroughfare in the early
1900s. 
*1976 -- Declared a National Historic Civil Engineering
Landmark
*2000 -- Designated a National Scenic Byway by the Federal
Government
*2002 -- Awarded the prestigious All American Road status
Further information about the National Road in Illinois can be
found at www.nationalroad.org



?THE CHALLENGE?


The cache is located at the posted coordinates. However, this is a
challenge cache. In order to log a &quot;found it&quot; you must find two
caches in each county within Illinois through which US 40 passes.
The caches must be within 1 mile of US 40. Obviously, the final can
not be used to meet the requirements.

The following seven counties are included along this route:
Clark County
Cumberland County
Effingham County
Fayette County
Bond County
Madison County
St Clair County

Your Mission: 
1. Find two caches in each of the seven Illinois Counties within
ONE mile of US 40.
2. Provide verification of your finds. Either send a GPX file to
the cache owner or create a public bookmark of your finds.
3. There are no date requirements, so all your finds prior to
the publish date of this cache can be used.
4. When you have provided proof of your finds along the National
Road, you may find and log a &quot;found it&quot; for the final cache, which
is within sight of US 40.
5. When you log the final, Would you please, pretty pretty
please post a photo of something interesting you&apos;ve seen along US
40. This photo does not need to be at a cache site. (New guidelines
prevent me from making this a requirement, but it would be awesome
to showcase this historical trail.)



 
Illinois&apos; second capitol city, Vandalia, was the terminus of the
National Road in 1838. The 4th state capitol building still exists
there today.

DESC: A very personal cemetery to add to Joranda&apos;s ILSQ series.
As you walk up the hill, you should pass right by my great, great
grandparents Myron Cyrus and Nancy Elizabeth Underwood. I first
walked up the hill about 20 years ago when I began my genealogy
quest. No internet or coordinates for me at that time. My field
research began at the Post Office in Loogootee where I asked some
questions. I was directed to a elderly resident who invited me into
her kitchen as she told me stories of my relatives and drew me a
map (which I still have) to Lovett Cemetery. 
Myron and &quot;Bessie&quot; were farmers who both spent their entire
lives in Fayette County. They were married on March 6 1889 at her
mother&apos;s home (Nancy Perine see

GC1Q87K) by H.H. Lovett. They had eight children, seven of
which reached adulthood including my great grandmother who died
from tuberculosis in 1936. My father remembers receiving quilts
from Bessie when he visited as a small boy.
Thanks for visiting this special cemetery.

Post Reviewer Note
2009-12-16 *gln, Greetings,

I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs.

I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache.
[b]
If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.
[/b] 

If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. 


From the guidelines...       http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint      &quot;... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem.  This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b]  normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing.&quot;  

Thanks for your understanding.

When you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an &quot;Owner Maintenance&quot; log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don&apos;t let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!



[B][RED]HOW TO RESPOND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS[/B][/RED]
Respond by posting a new [b] Note[/b]. Go to the cache page in question, and click on Log Your Visit. Select &quot;Post Note&quot; as the log type, and enter your message. Doing that, I&apos;ll know exactly what cache your message pertains to, which will speed the communication process. 

If you&apos;re reading this as email, don&apos;t reply to the sending address. It won&apos;t reach me. Follow the contact instructions above.

DESC: Should be a fairly easy park &amp; grab.  Pull off highway.  There&apos;s plenty of room to park along side of the road.  Cache is log only so BYOP.  Be careful as I noticed a fairly big hole in ground near cache.  Wouldn&apos;t recommend at night.
10+ years ago, 6 local teenagers were killed in a motor vehicle accident near here.  There&apos;s a memorial to them on the side of the road down from the cache.  Take a minute to look at it.  Although I didn&apos;t know them personally, I did know some of their families and remember that the whole community was touched by the tragedy.  

One of my favorite Jason Aldean songs is a song called &quot;Good To Go&quot;.    The best part of it says &quot;I&apos;m not planning on leaving&apos; yet but the truth is you just never know, and if this is as good as it gets, man , I think I&apos;m good to go&quot;.  I hope these kids were.

DESC: This is a real treasure in Joranda&apos;s Illinois Spirit Quest. You are
looking for a magnetic keycase in Sugg Cemetery which is located in
Bond County. While here, please take time to visit the nearby
Revolutionary War Soldiers&apos; graves as well as the Civil War
Veteran&apos;s resting place. There is also a very informative plaque at
the flagpole that honors a local man, John DeLaurenti who helped
save this cemetery from becoming a forgotten one.


 
 
&quot;CHARLES JOHNSON was born in North Carolina in 1757. After the
outbreak of the war, he joined the State militia and participated
in the battles of Cowpens and Guilford Court House. In 1817 he
became a resident of Illinois Territory, settling in Bond County.
He died in 1821 and is buried in the Old Sugg cemetery, near the
village of Pocahontas. His grave is marked by a United States
tombstone, upon which is engraved his military
service.&quot;




 
&quot;WILLIAMSON PLANT was a native of Virginia;  was born in the
county of Louisa in 1763. He early enlisted in the war in the Fifth
Regiment, under Captain Richard Clough in the Virginia line of
troops. He again enlisted in the militia, serving at various times
until the close of the war. He came to Illinois, settling in Bond
County in the town of Pocahontas, where he died in 1830, and is
buried in the old grave-yard there.&quot;

2009-12-23 sgtmta, Stopped and found this one while on the way to Ohio for the holidays.  Relatively easy find once we managed to find the right road to the cemetery.  Rather soggy.  Kids saw 5 deer while waiting in the van for us.  Then the van got stuck as we tried to leave (I told my hubby not to drive in as far as he did  :-)  )  This was our Bond County find for the SLAGA County Challenge.  TFTC in a fascinating cemetery.

Got kinda lucky as we jumped off the highway and had to fly by the seat of our pants to find the entrance.  We pulled down to within about 0.18 from GZ and hoofed it the rest of the way.

Beautiful cemetery which was enhanced by the fall foliage.  Will upload some pics soon!

As for the cache - easy peasy meezy.

DESC: Not a well travel road - except during the farming season.
The well-known surrealistic piece introduced the image of the soft melting pocket watch. It epitomizes Dalí&apos;s theory of &apos;softness&apos; and &apos;hardness&apos;, which was central to his thinking at the time.
     Although fundamentally part of Dalí&apos;s Freudian phase, the imagery predicts his transition to the scientific phase, which occurred after the dropping of the atomic bomb in 1945.
     It is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange &quot;monster&quot; that Dalí used in several period pieces to represent himself - the abstract form becoming something of a self portrait, reappearing frequently in his work. The orange clock at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants. Dali often used ants in his paintings as a symbol for death. Another source, a book called Salvador Dali tells us that the one clock was about the difficulties of birth, while another clock is to show the trauma of pre-birth.
     In general the tree means life, but, in this case, it has the same function as the rest of the elements in the picture: to impress anxiety and, in a certain way, terror, although it is likely that it was conceived as a functional element on which to drape one of the watches. The golden cliffs in the upper right hand corner are reminiscent of Dalí&apos;s homeland, Catalonia, and are derived from the rocks and cliffs at Cape Creus, where the Pyrenees meet the sea.[1]
     It is rumored that the painting was sprinkled with red wine shortly after it was complete, as was the Mona Lisa.
     The original idea of this painting came to Dalí on a hot summer&apos;s day. He was at home with a headache while Gala was out shopping. After his meal he noticed some half eaten Camembert cheese and how runny it had become on account of the heat of the sunny day. That night, while he had been searching his soul for something to paint, he had a dream of clocks melting on a landscape. He went back to the unfinished painting he had been working on, which had a plain landscape with rocky cliffs in the background and a tree on a platform. Over two or three hours he added in the melting pocket watches which made this the iconic image it is today.
     There is a broken sundial on a wall facing Dalí&apos;s house in Port Lligat. The gnomon, protruding from the wall, has long since broken off. It is less than fifty feet from the door of Dalí&apos;s house. It is pale blue in colour, and today, the paint is fading. The watches in The Persistence of Memory are also a pale blue. The numbers on the sundial are on the bottom of the square sundial, giving the appearance of the numbers having &quot;melted&quot; into place.
    The painting was first exhibited in Paris at the Galerie Pierre Colle in 1931, where it was purchased by the New York gallerist Julien Levy for $250. In 1933 it was sold to Mrs. Stanley B. Resor, who donated the piece anonymously to the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1934..

We had over 200 caches on our list but we wondered just how many we could do. I&apos;m thinking we stopped at almost 150+ caches and logged about 140. This shattered my old personel best of 57. Great day and great company. Brawny managed to squeak over 5000.  What a day indeed! TFTC!!

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4902. (39 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

We had over 200 caches on our list but we wondered just how many we could do. I&apos;m thinking we stopped at almost 150+ caches and logged about 140. This shattered my old personel best of 57. Great day and great company. Brawny managed to squeak over 5000.  What a day indeed! TFTC!!

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4908. (45 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

DESC: On the beaten path. This is muggles territory. They like to walk this way and that way. Not a nature walk, although one muggle described it as the garden of eden. That was a compliment but a bit of a stretch.
The cache is in a waterproof container. Inside is a logbook along with eraser tops for pencils. The erasers are taped over the hole keeping about a dozen hibiscus seeds. At least I think they are hibiscus. They could be double hollyhocks. I honestly don&apos;t remember, but lean heavily toward the hibiscus. They are there for the taking &amp; planting. There is parking very close to this one. C&apos;mon cachers take the entranceway, the sky is the limit! All are welcome as I am the property owner.

On my way to Cape from Sparta and catching up on an area I&apos;ve not cached in a while. Nicely done little cache. For some reason, my GPSr was wanting to take me 15&apos; out into the street, SE of the cache. Double-checked my manual coordinate entry and it was all spot on. Go figure. Had to use the hint to get in the right area. Shot a set of coord&apos;s, averaged 50 times. Looking at the logs, it doesn&apos;t seem anyone else has [i]posted[/i] similar problems. I&apos;ll post my coord&apos;s anyway, from the &apos;for what it&apos;s worth&apos; department.

Took: eraser full of seeds. Looks like they need to be planted in the Spring.

Water Lilies (or Nympheas) is a series of approximately 250 oil paintings by French Impressionist Claude Monet (1840-1926). The paintings depict Monet&apos;s flower garden at Giverny and were the main focus of Monet&apos;s artistic production during the last thirty years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from cataracts.

2009-08-25 Gerhardus, What a day!!! Brawny Bear, Happykraut and I drove 3 hrs to meet up with Mike Anderson1492 for a little geocaching. We had over 200 caches on our list but we wondered just how many we could do. I&apos;m thinking we stopped at almost 150+ caches and logged about 140. This shattered my old personel best of 57. Great day and great company. Brawny managed to squeak over 5000.  What a day indeed! TFTC!!

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4895. (32 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

 <desc>Portrait of Félix Fénéon  by Flutterblies &amp; Juliebug2007
Cache ID: GC1PCR0
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.5/T2.5
DESC: If you&apos;ve got the time bring a couple of large garbage bags and some gloves.  I suspect people have been using area for dumping trash.  Watch out for the traffic as well, probably best if little geocachers stayed in the car.  Cache is very close to parking area.
In this painting Signac portrays his friend Félix Fénéon, an influential French critic. Rather than literally depicting his appearance, Signac suggests his character, using line, color, pattern, and pose to evoke Fénéon&apos;s theatrical personality and creative energy. Carrying a top hat, gloves, and a cane, Fénéon resembles a fin-de-siècle dandy. He strides across a stage to offer a flower to an unseen figure against a lively kaleidoscopic backdrop of swirling colors, which echoes the rhythmic, linear designs of Art Nouveau.

Signac based this pinwheel design on a Japanese print that was probably a design for a kimono but substituted his own colors and patterns, such as the stars in the lower right corner. This may be a reference to Fénéon&apos;s interest in the United States;  the critic apparently cultivated a resemblance to Uncle Sam, complete with top hat and goatee.

Signac called his painting, Portrait of Félix Fénéon in 1890, Opus 217: Against the Enamel of a Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angles, Tones, and Tints. The title refers to the combination of sounds, lines, and colors that symbolist artists drew upon to convey the inner world of their subjects.

In this portrait Signac captures the dynamic movement implied in his title by using a technique called pointillism. This style was based on scientific theories of color and perception that called for dabbing the canvas with tiny dots of pure pigment. Seen from a distance, the painting&apos;s broken strokes blend together into luminous hues, and the shapes and colors seem to vibrate with energy.

Pointillism is a style of painting in which small distinct points of primary colors create the impression of a wide selection of secondary and intermediate colors. Aside from color &quot;mixing&quot; phenomena, there is the simpler graphic phenomena of depicted imagery emerging from disparate points. Historically, Pointillism has been a figurative mode of executing a painting, as opposed to an abstract modality of expression.
The practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the more common methods of blending pigments on a palette or using the many commercially available premixed colors. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses, Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow and Black (called &quot;CMYK&quot;). Televisions, computer monitors use a pointillist technique to represent images but with Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.

After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

Took 2 TB&apos;s to move to the KC Picnic.

We&apos;ve been to these grounds before, I think, but I couldn&apos;t find a cache in my Found list to confirm that. We did our best to avoid damaging any of the plantings, even taking the long way around to search the outside of the garden. I spotted the cache and Mean Gene did the retrieval. TNLNSL.

Cache is an orange camping match container. This cache is log only so BYOP. This cache rests in a quiet rural cemetery that is located between two mounds of earth. These mounds are manmade mounds of spoils from the local coal mine. Before the mounds were created the cemetery was surrounded by woods and was a party spot for the local teenagers. In the 70?s one such teenager felt the call of nature, went into the woods and discovered a dead body. I suspect this probably placed a damper on the party for the night.

D2.5/T3.0
DESC: Please be respectful when visiting.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
 
The Hunt of the Unicorn is a series of seven tapestries dating from 1495?1505. The tapestries, often referred to as the Unicorn Tapestries, show a group of noblemen and hunters in pursuit of a unicorn.

Much of the tapestries&apos; history is disputed and there are many theories about their original purpose and meaning, including suggestions that the seven tapestries were not originally hung together. However it seems likely that they were commissioned by Anne of Brittany to celebrate her marriage to Charles VIII, King of France.[1]

The two major interpretations of the tapestries hinge on pagan and Christian symbolism. The pagan interpretation focuses on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers, whereas Christian writings interpret the unicorn and its death as the Passion of Christ. The unicorn has long been identified as a symbol of Christ by Christian writers, allowing the traditionally pagan symbolism of the unicorn to become acceptable within religious doctrine. The original myths surrounding the Hunt of the Unicorn refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a virgin maiden;  subsequently, Christian scholars translated this into an allegory for Christ&apos;s relationship with the Virgin Mary.

The tapestries were owned by the La Rochefoucauld family of France for several centuries. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. bought them in 1922 for about a million dollars and donated them to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1937. They now hang in The Cloisters which houses the museum&apos;s medieval collection. There is a similar set of tapestries called The Lady and the Unicorn series made around the same time located in the Musée National du Moyen Âge, otherwise known as the Musee de Cluny, in Paris.

2009-08-06 orion52, I agree with Dr. Who and Solarwib. Your terrain rating suggests somewhere other than where the coords are placing everybody. I suspect that the coords are off considerably. If that is not the case the cache is very well hidden or worse yet missing. I believe the circumstances bear your attention.
Didn&apos;t find it
2009-07-28 Dr. Who and K-9, The coords took us to the open area around some graves, not close to a tree. We checked the closest trees but no luck. The terrain suggest some bushwhacking but then the coords would be seriously off.

2009-06-18 orion52, F#168@0850hrs. FTF. Solved puzzle, I thought. Went to coordinates (approximately 3 miles west of Norris City which I thought was odd, being no where near the waypoint). Middle of nowhere and there was nothing near the aforementioned coordinates, should have trusted my instincts that those coordinates were wrong!!! Decided to drive to waypoint coordinates, once there remembered a likely place for a cache. Went there and started a systematic search of the area. 30 minutes later I have cache in hand. This was quite a hunt. TFTC

This cache is located in Gillespie City Cemetery in Gillespie Illinois. Terrain and difficulty level are based on the wall search that may required in the vicinity of the cache itself. 

This cache was placed in Gillespie City Cemetery and is being placed to put Gillespie on the map for all Geocachers to search in. 

In order to locate this cache, some searching may be required near ground level, hence the reasoning for difficulty level. Container is a medium sized pill container and is painted green in color. Log available, BYOP, some room for small tradeables.

DESC: This cache is located in the Simon Pomatto Memorial Park in Gillespie, Illinois. Difficulty ratings are based upon some climbing is involved.
This cache was placed in the Simon Pomatto Memorial Park and is being placed to put Gillespie on the map for all Geocachers to search in. 

The signage within states &quot;This park was built by the family and friends of Simon Pomatto, who served as Alderman from  April 27th, 1993 until his death on April 6th, 1997. 

Simon had mentioned that the city of Gillespie was in need of an old fashioned city park. In memory of Simon, his wife had this park constructed in his honor. 

In order to locate this cache, climbing is involved and will not be seen from ground level, hence the reasoning for difficulty level. Container is a small pill container and is painted green in color. Log only, no room for tradeables.

Congratulations adt1982, sneakygeogirl and bigskykevin fopr the Tri-FtF Honors.

Out caching to grab some of the Illinois counties on the SLAGA Challenge. I had stopped here on Tuesday night and had passed the opportunity by since four teenage boys were just walking out on the trail. Today in the light of day, I was glad that I had waited. I would have missed the very nice park and scenery. Container had some water but the double-bags had kept the contents nice and dry. I emptied the water and dried the container.

DESC: This cache is located in an area of Edwardsville I used to explore everyday with my friends when we were kids.
I am going to log this as a 3 in difficulty and 3 terrain based on the adventure at hand.  If it has recently rained, the trek to the cache could be very interesting.

I hope you enjoy the cache as much fun as it was for me to place it.

This is going to be fun...

8/17/2009:    
Due to recent feedback, interesting emails, I am posting a quick to assist those cachers who wish to locate this cache or search for it...

-  It is in an old drainage ditch dating back to the early 30&apos;s and is NOT a free flowing creek, so water can stagnate.  --  It is not sewage.  Only rain water filters into the USUALLY dried out creek bed.

-  After a rain, the creek bed can accumulate water and make finding this cache difficult, and even more difficult to get to.  Be forewarned that it may be best to attempt this cache during a dry spell.

-  Yes, currently it is a micro, however, showing some friends who cache a lot from out of state they all agreed with the hint this could stay a micro.

Note:  Kids used to and still play in this area.  This is not a quick park and grab, even though it is 300 feet from the road.

12-27-2009:   Went with a friend to look at cache and it is doing well.  There is a deceased deer across the creek, along the path you may wish to try so be forewarned.   

I will also update with the coords for the best way to approach.
Hint: Note:   You have to enter the dried out creek bed, no hill climbing once you are down there, until you have get out.

Look on the vines for the answer you seek.

2009-11-06 myotis, I was in the area and had my boots (to protect from all the concealed glass) so I decided to try again.  The logs said it was supposed to be a ammo can now but there was no indication if it had been switched out.  So I was not sure.  With lots of the leaves off and the guidiance in the note, I found the match container pretty easy this time.  It still was rough getting down there.  I also found the pipe where the sewage smell is coming from. So I was glad to quickly find it as this is one of the worst places I have ever hunted for a cache.

2009-10-03 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter (signing the logs as “MG/TR/RO” for brevity) for a return trip to the Pana area on a cool overcast early Fall day – perfect geocaching weather! This one lives up to its 3/3 rating. The chunks of concrete prevented The Rooter from attempting going down to the creek bed, so Mean Gene and I were on our own. We wandered around for awhile, but eventually I got really lucky and spotted it near GZ. TNLNSL. Thanks, killrb14, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

2009-09-30 killrb14, The cache is on the tree, camo matchstick holder, no foliage around it...about 3 feet from base of tree.  You can actually take the creek behind the tree, up a slight incline and get to the tree.   The part of the tree facing the mud cliff is where it is at.  

Rest assured the new container will be forthcoming this weekend.  I just made it back from 8 weeks of military duty in Alabama and will get it upgraded.

DESC: 
Let&apos;s face it, DuQuoin needs caches so we decided to put one at Wal-Mart.  This is not meant to offend PomonaCaches who have caches at three other Wal-Mart locations.  It just happened to be that DQ needed caches and my mom has worked at WM for 30 years and she could help to keep an eye on this one.  The cache is an altoids container that contains only a log sheet so BYOP.  It might hold a geocoin or TB if nothing is attached.  This is a very high muggle area so great stealth is needed!!!  Please place the cache back carefully.  

Since DuQuoin draws people from all over the world to the fairgrounds for the many events including the DuQuoin State Fair, we ask that when you log your find on the internet, tell us where you are from.  It is fun to see the different places that come together for events.    Thanks.  Happy caching!

This cache is a 30 calibur ammo box. The cache is dedicated to WWE wrestling entertainment.  Our family are huge wrestling fans and John Cena has been a long-time favorite, hence the name of the cache.  Original contents includes: The Rundown movie, wrestling poster from WM 24 (which we were at), two TBs, and some small action figures. Do not worry about trespassing, it is our property. Just please dont drive on the grass. You may pull into the driveway or off to the side of the road. Yard can get soggy after a heavy rain. Coordinates should be right on but did vary by a number or two. On a second try the last digits were N 867 W 054 just in case.

After it was all said and down, there were 23 total attempts at caches, 17 of those were found, 4 were DNF&apos;s, and 2 were noted due to various circumstances.  The following is a story of one of those caches:

This was the first cache of the day, was a pretty straightforward and easy find.  It&apos;s fall now, so a lot of muggles aren&apos;t using the marina anymore, and this made it really easy to snag and tag without being seen.  TFTC!

Cache is a small lock-n-lock box painted to match it surrounds.  Located near the lakeside picnic area, not far into the tree line.  Cache is accessible year round, but park does close during the overnight hours except in designated camping areas.

***And due to popular demand.... an apparent much needed warning....    this cache is guarded by many hundreds of winged blood suckers.....  (took me along time to train these guys but they do their job well apparently)
Hint: In the footprint of a fallen giant!

This was the fifth cache of the day.  I got to the coordinates and spent a while looking, while my GPS had me walking in circles.  I decided to check the hint, and it makes pefect sense to me where it /should/ be, but it wasn&apos;t there.  I spent so much time at this one spot looking today.  Maybe the lack of blood-sucking winged creatures was proof that they had run off with the cache... who knows.  Finally, due to my extensive list and my attempt to find all the Murphysboro caches today, I decided to put this one in my &quot;try again later&quot; pile.  It was fun never-the-less.

P.S.  I did find something interesting at what I believe is the cache site.  Check it out in the image I uploaded.

Small cache in disguise. Permission given for cache placement by Cheryl Graff.  In the 1800&apos;s farmers began building places for them to socialize and discuss the agriculteral business.  When the railroads began over charging for freight and such the farmers, also known as grangers, began having private meetings in their &quot;grange halls&quot; to discuss how they could stop the railroads.  The farmers fought the railroads and with the help of the government many Granger Laws were put into effect to protect the farmers. (much to the surprise of everyone, as most did not believe anyone could fight the railroads.)

When I got it, I first looked in your neighbor&apos;s yard under all the vines.  I would suggest editing the cache page to describe your yard so cacher don&apos;t look in other yards.

location during the 1925 Tri-State Tornado

 

America?s Worst Tornado
The Great Tri-State Tornado of 1925

This deadly storm that swept through Missouri, Illinois
and
Indiana left a 219-mile path of destruction. At 1:01 pm on
March
18, 1925, the Great Tri-State Tornado started out from the
Ozarks
in southeastern Missouri, headed eastward through southern
Illinois
and lifted in southwestern Indiana after a duration of three and
a
half hours. The tornado traveled at an average speed of 62
mph,
which is approximately double the speed of an average tornado.
The
wind speeds of the funnel were 261 to 318 mph. The tornado
was
rated as an F5 on the Fujita Scale.

In total, there were 652 deaths and more than 2,000 people
injured. The number of deaths was double the number of the
second
deadliest tornado in U.S. history.

The Great Tri-State Tornado destroyed 15,000 homes and
damaged
more than 164 square miles (almost 50 times more than the
average
tornado). Property damage was $16.5 million (at that time)
and
would be almost $2 billion at today&apos;s prices.

Murphysboro : 234 deaths with at least 25 in three schools
and
40% destruction. This was the largest death toll within a
single
city in US history. Losses totaled about $10,000,000

Longfellow School, essentially destroyed by the Tri-State
Tornado of 1925, was demolished and became a city park and the
home
field of the Murphysboro Clarkes vintage baseball team. A
plaque
can be found there honoring those children and teachers
killed
during the infamous storm.

This is the location where Longfellow School once stood, all
that
remains today of the School itself is a large stone block that
so
proudly identified the building.

Cache ID: GC1Y5JF
Traditional Cache

D1.5/T1.5
DESC: Labyrinth of Inspiration - St Joseph Memorial Hospital
The Labyrinth was a gift from the St. Joseph Memorial Hospital Auxiliary. It was dedicated on Friday, May 11, 2007 in honor of the Adorers of the Blood of Christ. Their service began in 1956, following in the footsteps of the Franciscan Sisters, who opened the first Murphysboro Hospital, St. Andrew&apos;s.  

Take a journey through the St Joseph Memorial Hospital Labyrinth, it&apos;s a walking meditaion device with a single path begining at the edge, taking you on a journey of turns and eventually leading you to the center.

The cache, a small lock-n-lock box painted to match its surroundings, is located very near the labyrinth.  While visting, feel free to utilize the labyrinth and enjoy this unique experience while searching for your own calming resolution.
Hint: Low and below.

On the way over from Carterville to attend the Wacky Hat Flash Mob, I picked up a few of the local caches.  Found this one pretty easily and was a little frightened by the guardian of the cache, natural and unnatural.

2009-11-07 TsukiakariUsagi, So today was a journey to break a lot of personal records... 1 day, 1 city, 31 caches bookmarked, 9 hours of daylight (8:15am - 5:15pm)... After it was all said and down, there were 23 total attempts at caches, 17 of those were found, 4 were DNF&apos;s, and 2 were noted due to various circumstances.  The following is a story of one of those caches:
-----
This was my eighth cache for today.  I found it relatively quickly, after I stopped to pick up the tombstone that had fallen over, quite a while ago it seems based on the impression in the ground.  I haven&apos;t ever seen a cache container quite like this before, which is always fun and interesting because it helps to add to my arsenal of knowledge for when I do start placing my own caches.  The log was pretty soaking wet, so I didn&apos;t bother to take it out and sign it.  It really should be replaced, but TFTC regardless!  As a side note, RIP to the anonymous person whose tombstone I restored to standing.  The etching on it was impossibly to clearly read any longer;  however, I believe I did manage to pick out an 1898 from it, most likely the year this person passed away.

2009-11-28 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene (signing logs as “MG/RO” for brevity) on our final tour of Mason County IL for the [i]Line of Masons[/i] cache series, on a delightful 65 degree day – not bad for the last weekend of November – perfect geocaching weather! This was our first cache of the day. We had searched for no more than 30 seconds when a car pulled up with a somewhat elderly woman in it. I went over to chat with her as Mean Gene continued the search;  she was excited to tell me that she&apos;d just seen some trumpeter swans on an adjacent pond about 1/4 mile away. As we chatted and I was describing the game we were playing to her, Mean Gene found the cache and held it up for all to see. She said her son would like this game, so Mean Gene gave her the URL. 

After logging the cache, we drove down the road apiece to find the trumpeters, but didn&apos;t spot them before the next cache called us. TNLNSL. Thanks, awanderer, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

ANCIENT SEAS

During the Paleozoic Era, 500 to 400 million years ago the continents experienced tremendous mountain building and many times shallow seas covered North America.  The first ancient organisms such as crinoids, coral, brachiopods and trilobites appeared.  The fossilized remains of the inhabitants make up the many layers of limestone deposited on the flat-bottomed sea and are now buried below the many bluffs that border the river floodplains.

THE ICE AGE

Between 10,000 and 1.6 million years ago this area of the earth experienced four periods of ice and thaw, glaciers carved North America.  Huge lakes and rivers came and went.  With each glacial retreat, icy melt-water cut the upper Mississippi River deeper into the rock.  Ice sheets from the East and West also pushed the Mississippi sideways, forcing it into the Illinois River for a time.  This is why the Illinois River Valley is so large.  Ten thousand years ago the Ice Age ends.  The Mississippi River is fully formed.

PLEISTOCENE DEPOSITS AND LANDFORMS

The Glossary of Geology describes a floodplain as the surface or strip of relatively smooth land adjacent to a stream channel that has been produced by the stream&apos;s erosion and deposition actions;  the area covered with water when the stream overflows its banks at times of high water.  It is built by alluvium carried by the stream during floods and deposited in the sluggish water beyond the influence of the swiftest current.

The upper Mississippi River floodplain just north of the posted coordinates is largely inundated by backwater from the Melvin Price Locks and Dam at Alton, Illinois.  Studies of the sedimentology and bathymetry (measuring water depth and charting bottom topography) of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers were conducted in Pool 26 above the locks and dam at Alton by the Illinois State Water Survey, the Illinois State Geological Survey, and the Illinois State Natural History Survey in the early 1980s.  The Surveys were examining the effects of boat traffic on inhabitants of the riverine ecosystem (Schnepper et al. 1981, Goodwin and Masters 1983).
  
They found that, with few exceptions, bottom materials in the deeper parts of the channel, where it has been dredged for navigation, are mainly sand.  In shallower parts of the channel bottom, silt is the major constituent of the sediments.  Navigation traffic may contribute greatly to the relative lack of clay and silt in the deeper parts of the channels.  Bottom-dwelling organisms living such as clams, mussels, and worms (food source for fish, ducks, and early man) have difficulty living in a sandy habitat.  Creating wetlands along the valley bottom floodplains, as some government agencies are now doing, should improve bottom habitats outside the navigation channels.  This in turn will provide a better environment for fish and waterfowl.

ON GOING CHANGE ---- MODERN EPOCH

Each river is shaped by many things:  its speed, the sediment it carries, the slope it runs down, the rock over which it passes and even the plants (riparian) nearby.  Change anything and the river behaves differently, taking a new path.  Ten thousand years ago through tomorrow the great cycle continues.  Rain and snow-melt fill the Mississippi River, which in turn feeds the Gulf of Mexico.  Wind and water erode rocks and wash away soil.  The river carries and deposits this sediment down stream ?.constant change.

Many thanks to Jessica Harder, Park Ranger, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers ? St. Louis District for providing the guidelines necessary to obtain permission to establish an EarthCache at this location and to the museum staff for providing some of the educational information contained in this publication.

It is open 7 days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  All programs and tours are free.  The museum itself is self-guided.  The staff does conduct tours of the locks and dam daily, for public walk-ins only, at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.  Both the museum and locks tour are handicap accessible.   Group tours are also available and may be scheduled by calling 1-800-258-6645.
  
IN ORDER TO LOG THIS FIND YOU MUST:

Take and post a picture of yourself with your GPS at the designated coordinates and e-mail the answers to the following questions to me.

1)	The Mississippi River bed is shallow at this area causing the river to meander from side to side.  What is the geological term used to describe the results of this erosion and deposition action?

2)	 What is the elevation at the posted coordinates from the observation deck?

2009-11-14 myotis, I forgot to point out this statement is wrong:  &quot;The upper Mississippi River floodplain just north of the posted coordinates is largely inundated by backwater from the Melvin Price Locks and Dam at Alton, Illinois.&quot;

They are not impacted by the river.  The platform is on a levee that separates them from the river.  They are drained by the East Alton pumping station which you can see from the platform.  The backwaters that are inundated by the dam cannot be seen from the platform.  If you drive 67 over in MO, you will see backwaters on the right side of the road.  They were not under water before the dam was built.  They had dead trees in them for many years before they finally fell over several years ago.  Additionally, those waters to the North are not actually backwaters.  The platform is on Skinney Island.  Those waters are the old side channel.

What is a Watershed?
A watershed is basically an area of land that drains to a water
feature such as a river, creek or lake. As the rain falls, the soil
will absorb most of the water until it becomes saturated. When the
soil can no longer hold the water, it becomes run off and flow
towards creeks, rivers and lakes.


Why do we need a Watershed?
The soil, sand and rock found in the ground acts as a filter or
sponge for the rain and surface water. Contaminants from roads,
oils, pesticides re mixed with the rain water and absorbed into the
soil. As the contaminated water filters through the soil, sand and
rocks, it purifies the water so that when it reaches the ground
water (the underground rivers) it has less contaminates to pollute
the rivers and lakes that it flows into.
In urban areas, where there is more concrete and asphalt due to
roads and parking lots, water cannot be absorbed into the soil as
easily and quickly runs into the sewers and from there into creeks,
rivers and lakes which is a major cause of pollution. Urban
planners are now beginning to understand the importance a watershed
to control the pollution of rivers and lakes near urban areas.
Many watersheds disguise themselves as ponds and small lakes. A
healthy watershed will support fish and other wildlife and an
abundance of vegetation. A well maintained watershed can provide a
peaceful habitat, become a recreational area with boating, hiking,
fishing and picnicking or become an educational nature
center.


Cahokia Creek/Holiday Shores Lake
Watershed
The area north and north east of Edwardsville IL is known as the
Cahokia Creek/Holiday Shores Lake watershed. The elevation ranges
from 672 feet above sea level to the north to390 feet above sea
level at the Mississippi River. Water flows into local creeks that
then empty into the Cahokia Creek. Holiday Shores Lake is a
man-made dammed lake for the Holiday Shores subdivision. Much of
the water from Holiday Shores Lake is run-off from the homes and
roads in the subdivision.

Watershed Nature Center

 The Watershed Nature Center in Edwardsville IL is in the lower
elevation of the Cahokia Creek/Holiday Shores Lake watershed area
along the Cahokia Creek at approximately 430 feet elevation above
sea level. Being in the low end of the Cahokia Creek/Holiday Shores
Lake watershed, rain water and runoff from Edwardsville and the
surrounding communities empty into the creeks of the area and into
both the Watershed Nature Center?s ponds and Cahokia Creek.

The Watershed Nature Center started out as a
     sewage lagoon. In 1991 local activist proposed to turn the
     abandoned lagoon into a nature preserve. Many members of the
     community donated time and money to help create the wetlands,
     tallgrass prairie and hiking trails through the Watershed
     Nature Center. A grant from the Illinois Department of
     Conservation helped in the building of the Welcome Center.
The Nature Center consists of two lakes, marsh area, tall grass
prairie and wooded forest with a paved and woodchip path
surrounding the lakes. The path to the south of the Welcome Center
is handicapped accessible. Depending on the time of year, you may
see geese, egrets and various other wild life visiting the Nature
Center. The Watershed Nature Center is especially important because
birds in the midwest are losing their habitat due to farming,
construction and other human factors impacting their natural
habitat. Re-developing the once abundant prairie lands with native
species of plants not only preserve the prairie land, but act as
food for birds migrating through the area. As you walk the trails,
you will see bird houses that attract certain species of birds.
Fish, frogs, insects and other aquatic life thrive in the waters of
the Nature Center proving food to other wild life as well as
keeping the waters healthy.
The above coordinates will take you to a sign. You can pick up a
map at this sign or follow the coordinates below to the locations
to answer the questions to log this Earthcache. If you have the
time, take a walk around the entire trail and enjoy the peace and
beauty of the area.
Parking Coordinates: N38 49.017 W89 58.497
The watershed asks that you observe the following
guidelines:

Day visits only
Keep dogs on leashes at all times
No bikes or rollerblades

what?
2. Select two (2) of the areas listed below and email me the
answers to the questions. Do not put your answers in your log or it
will get deleted.
3. Take a picture of yourself with your GPSr at one of your two
choice locations and post it with your log. Logs without a picture
will also get deleted.

DESC: Bethel Lutheran Church. Square locking container camo
painted.
Martin Luther wrote the Small Catechism as a method of imparting
the basics of Christianity to congregations in 1529. It was to be
learned and memorized by the people. The catechisms provide
easy-to-understand instructional and devotional material on the Ten
Commandments, the Apostles&apos; Creed, the Lord&apos;s Prayer, baptism, and
the Lord&apos;s Supper. Luther incorporated questions and answers in the
catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be
learned by rote, &quot;the way monkeys do it&quot;, but understood. After a
question is asked, an answer is provided that is straight from the
scriptures. Then there is that famous question;  &quot;What does this
mean?&quot; Anyone who has been through confirmation in a Lutheran
Church recognized what the title of this cache means.
Bethel Lutheran Church is a member of the Lutheran Church -
Missouri Synod.
Please be respectful when searching the grounds of the church
for the cache.

 You may search for this cache from 12:00noon until dark
Sunday-Friday and all day Saturday.

 These restriction are due to the fact that we have preschool M-F
and church services on Sunday morning.
Original contents: Log/Pencil, CITO container, FTF surprise, 3-D
glasses, Horseshoe keyring, Heart pin with a cross, lanyard, and
several Luther seal decals. Happy Hunting.

 Cache placed on property with consent of church congregation
providing that the time restrictions are upheld.

Hint: Look inside

2009-12-06 myotis, This one was special to me.  Brought back lots of memories.  I used to live by here and I would walk by where the cache is everyday on my daily walk.  On June 26, 2001, I hid my first cache about 400 feet from this one.  It was called Emerick Cache:  GCDE2 (notice the low GC code!).  So thanks so much bringing me back to my old stomping grounds!

However, this cache will get muggled.  You really need to hide it better.  As I said I used to walk right by that spot everyday and anyone walking by can easily see it.

Got the new caches on my way home from the event on I-64.  Nice job on them.  Enjoyed them all.  But lost of glove if anyone finds one!  Thanks for a nice new set of caches.

I was in Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts (Eagle 1973), and Explorers.  Got a lot out of it and use some of the skills I learned as a scout caching.


Got to this one after dark.  Used my flashlight to read  the sign to see the park closed at 10 pm.  So I went and took the chilly walk to the cache.  Glad it was a quick find.  

Looking forward to the rest of the series.

 <desc>Kinkaid Lake Spillway by catdad
Cache ID: GC1Z8HF
Earthcache
SIZE: Not chosen
D2.5/T3.5
DESC: Kinkaid Lake is a manmade lake built in 1968, the lake encompasses 2,750 acres. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources manages approximately 4,000 acres surrounding the lake, including the spillway.
The topography of the surrounding area varies from sandstone bluff formations to rolling hills surrounding the lake. The spillway is a sandstone waterway that has eroded to display the layering of clastic formations.
A spillway is a structure used to provide for the controlled release of flows from a dam or levee into a downstream area. Spillways are located at the top of reservoir pool and release floods, so that the water does not overtop and damage or destroy the dam.

There are two types of spillways: controlled and uncontrolled.
A controlled spillway has mechanical structures or gates to regulate the rate of flow. This design allows nearly the full height of the dam to be used for water storage year-round, and flood waters can be released as required by opening one or more gates.
An uncontrolled spillway, in contrast, does not have gates;  when the water rises above the lip or crest of the spillway it begins to be released from the reservoir. The rate of discharge is controlled only by the depth of water within the reservoir

The posted coordinates will take you to a display of different Clastic rock formations. 
Clastic sedimentary rocks are rocks composed predominantly of broken pieces or clasts of older weathered and eroded rocks. Clastic sediments or sedimentary rocks are classified based on grain size, clast and cementing material composition, and texture.  Grain size determines the basic name of a clastic sedimentary rock. Grain size varies from clay in shales;  through silt in siltstones;  sand in sandstones;  and gravel, cobble, to boulder sized fragments in conglomerates and breccias. 
Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-size mineral or rock grains. Most sandstone is composed of quartz and/or feldspar because these are the most common minerals in the Earth&apos;s crust. Like sand, sandstone may be any color, but the most common colors are tan, brown, yellow, red, gray and white. Since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs and other topographic features, certain colors of sandstone have been strongly identified with certain regions.
Sandstones are formed from cemented grains that may either be fragments of a pre-existing rock or be mono-minerallic crystals. The cements binding these grains together are typically calcite, clays and silica. 
The formation of sandstone involves two principal stages. First, a layer or layers of sand accumulates as the result of sedimentation, either from water or from air. Typically, sedimentation occurs by the sand settling out from suspension;  i.e., ceasing to be rolled or bounced along the bottom of a body of water or ground surface. Once it has accumulated, the sand becomes sandstone when it is compacted by pressure of overlying deposits and cemented by the precipitation of minerals within the pore spaces between sand grains.

Shale is a fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock composed of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite. The ratio of clay to other minerals is variable. Shale is characterized by thin laminae or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness.
The process which forms shale is compaction. The fine particles that compose shale can remain suspended in water long after the larger and denser particles of sand have deposited. Shales are typically deposited in very slow moving water and are often found in lakes and lagoonal deposits, in river deltas, on floodplains and offshore from beach sands. 
Shales are typically composed of variable amounts of clay minerals and quartz grains and the typical color is gray. Addition of variable amounts of minor constituents alters the color of the rock. Black shale results from the presence of greater than one percent carbonaceous material and indicates a reducing environment. Red, brown and green colors are indicative of ferric oxide (hematite - reds), iron hydroxide (goethite - browns and limonite - yellow), or micaceous minerals (chlorite, biotite and illite ? greens).

To claim this Earthache;  you must post a picture of yourself at the spillway, and then email the answers to the following. Do not post answers in your log. 
1.	What type of spillway is this;  Controlled or Uncontrolled?
2.	What types of Clastic formations are present?
3.	Does the color of the layers change? If so, what are some of the colors present?

D1.5/T1.5
DESC: The Cache is located in Centennial Park. The path is mulch covered and is an easy hike. The cache is located about 20 feet off of the pathway.
This is the second in a series of caches in celebration of the 100 years of scouting. A cache will be placed for each rank that a Scout may achieve. 

History of the Tiger Cub Program:

&quot;In 1982, Tiger Cubs was started as a &quot;Pack-associated&quot; program with Tiger Cubs being 7 years old. They wore special orange T-shirts with iron-on &quot;badges&quot;. Beginning in 1996, when a Tiger Cub graduated to the Pack, he was presented with a &quot;Tiger Cub BSA&quot; strip that would be worn just below the right pocket of the blue uniform shirt. When the grade-based rank system was phased in in 1986, the age for beginning Tiger Cubs was lowered to First grade. In 2001, the current diamond-shaped Tiger Cub rank badge was introduced. In 2007, the Tiger Cub Den was fully integrated into the pack;  Tiger Cubs now wear the blue Cub Scout shirt.&quot;
www.meritbadge.org 

The container is a camo&apos;d peanut butter jar.

Please place items with the ideals of scouting in mind.

2009-12-26 myotis, Out caching in the MetroEast.  Had a great time thanks.

I was in Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts (Eagle 1973), and Explorers.  Got a lot out of it and use some of the skills I learned as a scout caching.


I got to this one close to dark.  Glad I was prepared and had a flashlight with me.  I am also glad I had previously GPSed the park so I knew where to start from and which trail to take.

DESC: UPDATE: OOPS - The correct coordinates of the restored one-room school near the High School are N38º38.323&apos; W088º56.477&apos;(NOT the location of the cache).

The coordinates given are the location of a restored one-room school near the High School. The building was at one time East Nation School. The cache is not at this location.
Marion County, like most counties, at one time had a one-room school every two miles so that no child would have to walk more than a mile to school. Alas, most of these have disappeared.  Marion County is unusual in that many of the former one-room-school locations are marked with a sign.

Touch Tones (DTMF) are a code we use every time we make a phone call.  Each Touch Tone consists of two sine waves -- one for the row the number is in and one for column the number is in.  The two attached wav files have the coordinates of the cache in Touch Tones.  The cache is a small container attached to a one-room-school location sign.  Small hint: I use a * for the decimal point,# for the degree symbol and omit the minute symbol.

Cache ID: GC134XG

SIZE: Micro
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: You&apos;re searching for a micro located at the edge of a cemetery. The cache is there to commemorate the burial place of Confederate General Bushrod Johnson. Well, he is kind of buried there. I mean he was buried there, and part of him still is there.
Johnson was a graduate of  West Point and served as an officer in the Seminole and Mexican-American wars. He had resigned from the army and moved to Tennessee by the time the Civil War erupted. At that time, he joined the Confederacy and became one of the better generals in that army, commanding a division and fighting at the battles of Fort Donelson, Shiloh, Perryville, Stones River and Chickamauga.

Here&apos;s where my family becomes involved. He was the commander who broke the Union line which resulted in the Confederate victory at Chickamauga. He did so just about exactly where the 21st Illinois, my Great Grandfather&apos;s unit, was positioned. The Confederacy, and Johnson, prevailed in the battle and my Great Grandfather was wounded and fought no more in the war. 

Following the war, Johnson became a professor at the University of Nashville and later retired to a farm near Brighton, in the heart of Yankee land. Ironically, numerous Union veterans in this particular area had fought in the battle of Chickamauga, and Johnson and the locals reportedly spent many a Saturday evening reliving their wartime adventures.

When Johnson died in 1880, he was buried in the Miles Station Cemetery. In 1975, his grave was dug up so his remains could be moved to be alongside his wife in Nashville, Tennessee. Unfortunately, his coffin had deteriorated, and they couldn&apos;t find too much of his remains. So while the remains they could find were transferred, some of them remain in Illinois.

You can read more about Johnson in &quot;Lee&apos;s Lieutenants&quot; or in his biography, &quot;Confederate Quaker General,&quot; which includes information about how his remains happened to be moved in the 1970s.

The cache is a match-safe container wrapped in camo tape, and it will be found near a marker located where the General&apos;s body was originally interred. Once you find the cache, be sure to check out the stone marker. You&apos;ll find it about 65 feet from the cache at 40 degrees (it&apos;s the closest stone marker to the cache).

You can access the cemetery from Miles Station Road, just a few miles north of Brighton. The cemetery is open from dawn until dusk daily, which is the only time the cache is available.

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4931. (68 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

A boy preacher named Isaac goes to a town in Illinois called
Patoka and gets all the children to &quot;misbehave&quot;. A young couple
have a murder to report and they go to the nearest town (Patoka) to
seek help but the town seems deserted. They are soon trapped in
Patoka with little chance of getting out alive.
The only exit from this nightmare is at the posted coordinates.
GOOD LUCK!

Orville is the oldest orphan at the Hideaway Orphans Home. He
accidentally winds up inside a truck that is heading to a top
secret lab. He is discovered and is turned over to Lester to help
load supplies into a rocket ship. While onboard, Orville hits the
ignition button and the rocket launches with them onboard. The
rocket files across the country, first over New York then to
Louisiana, where it lands in New Orleans, where the Mardi Gras is
in progress. They exit the craft and witness hideous creatures,
which are actually celebrants in masks and costumes, and decide
that they have landed on Mars.
Two escaped convicts, Harry the Horse and Mugsy, discover the
rocket and put on the space suits that they found inside. They then
head into New Orleans so that they can rob a bank. Lester and
Orville, also dressed in space suits, are accused of the crime and
quickly head back to the rocket, where Mugsy and Harry are waiting
for them. They force Lester and Orville to launch the rocket, and
they wind up landing on Venus. They exit the rocket, and Orville is
quickly captured by some guards and brought to Queen Allura. She
informs him that Venus is only inhabited by women and then men were
banished a long time ago. She takes a liking to him and decides
that he can remain if he promises to be true to her. He agrees, and
has Harry and Mugsy imprisoned for their crimes. However, Mugsy
convinces one of the female guards to flirt with Orville to prove
that he cannot be trusted. He betrays his word, and the Queen
orders all of them to leave Venus. They board the rocket for
another flight and land back on Earth. They are lauded as heroes,
and Allura, who is watching the celebration from Venus, sends a
ship to drop an egg on Orville&apos;s head.
Your mission: Go to Queen Allura to find out if you are allowed
to stay, or if you are banished.

DESC: NOTE:  The actual cache container has been moved from its original location because the pipe in which the container was hidden rusted off, and will most likely NOT be replaced.  The new location is approximately 40 Ft. directly east of the original cache location.
This cache is placed near a commemorative monument in the Lake Centralia - Salem Oilfield.  It depicts a beginning, a prelude to activity that would change men&apos;s destinies overnight.  Here is where the surge to Little Egypt had its origin.  Here is where farmers forgot about farming and thought about oil.  To mark the historical site for posterity, the Salem Lions Club placed this monument and presented it to W.C. &quot;Windy&quot; Kneale, superintendent of the Texas Company.

The City of Salem was transformed in the 1930&apos;s from a quiet-paced small town doing its best to recover from the Depression to a city hit with another severe jolt in its economy - known as &quot;the oil boom.&quot;  

Salem oil industries and land owners became a part of the business which was noted for having the second highest amount of oil production in any one area. In 1939, 93 million barrels of oil were pumped from Marion County&apos;s farmland. At the time producers were selling oil for fifty cents a barrell.

2009-05-29 Al &amp; Mylea, We are sorry for the long delay in enabling this cache.  We disabled the cache back during the winter and hadn&apos;t really decided what we were going to do about it.  We really like the historic location of this cache, pertinent to the oil boom in Salem, and want to continue to bring people to this area, so we have decided to keep the cache.  PLEASE NOTE:  THE ORIGINAL COORDINATES FOR THE CACHE LOCATION HAVE NOT CHANGED, BECAUSE WE STILL WANT TO DIRECT ATTENTION TO THE MONUMENT.  But the actual cache container location is now approximately 40 ft. to the East of the original location.

We hike to this cache from [i]Giant Oak Tree[/i] with new cachers Dave(?) and Carol http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=fe29ac58-2406-40e3-adf8-dc60abe99dce that we had just met there. 

I loaned Carol my Explorist 400 while we were on the trail so she help find their second cache. We searched the usual places in the area for about 15 minutes, going from likely place to likely place, but it was Carol who found the cache, in a relatively undistinguished spot. We were glad we ran into them today! TNLNSL. Thanks, possom, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, Saint Charles, MO.

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4927. (64 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: This regular sized geocache really is a place for bugs. But not those crawly, itchy ones. This one is for travel bugs. It&apos;ll accept travel coins too.
This travel bug hotel geocache should be easy to find, and in a very neat area. It&apos;s within a 10 minute drive from Interstate 57 and in a great state park setting.

You&apos;ll be looking for a one gallon plastic jug, wrapped in camouflage tape. The area also has a nice view of the lake, which recently was voted one of Illinois&apos; top seven wonders.

The cache is stocked with a variety of travel bugs, which I hope you&apos;ll swap and get them moving along. If you have one to trade, take a couple. If you don&apos;t, take only one.

Let&apos;s not forget to give a word of thanks to the cache-friendly folks at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (www.stateparks.com/wayne_fitzgerrell.html) and the good folks at Rend Lake Resort (www.rendlakeresort.com).

1. Geocache is placed on Department of Natural Resources managed property with permission.
2. Do not place the following items in the Geocache: Food items, inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials.
3. It is the visitors responsibility to orient themselves with policies and rules pertaining to this Department managed site.

If you can&apos;t find this one, you&apos;re not looking hard enough. But if you do need help, drop me an email and I&apos;ll send you a clue.

DESC: Take a Break. Have some &quot;Rest and Relaxation at Rend Lake Resort&quot; (RNR@RLR). And while you&apos;re at it, find the micro geocache I left there.
Rend Lake was recently voted one of the state&apos;s top seven wonders, and I can&apos;t think of a better place to take a break and do a little geocaching than along the lake in Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park (www.stateparks.com/wayne_fitzgerrell.html) where you&apos;ll also find an A-1 Resort. The park offers great camping and picnicking, and you can visit the resort and boat, swim, play tennis or golf, get a great meal, have a cold one and enjoy the gift shop. You can rent all kinds of watercraft or a bike, and even hire a guide to take you fishing. Oh yeah, you can also go geocaching there. 

There are several geocaches located in the park to keep you busy, including this micro that shouldn&apos;t be too hard to find. It is about the size and shape of a match-safe container. And while looking, you&apos;ll have a great view of the lake and some of the amenities offered at the resort (www.rendlakeresort.com).

Let&apos;s not forget to give a word of thanks to the cache-friendly folks at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the good people at Rend Lake Resort.

1. Geocache is placed on Department of Natural Resources managed property with permission.
2. Do not place the following items in the Geocache: Food items, inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials.
3. It is the visitors responsibility to orient themselves with policies and rules pertaining to this Department managed site.
Hint: You&apos;ll find it if you hang around long enough.

DESC: Well, you can go to the cache, which is a simple micro, but you can&apos;t go any farther. There&apos;s a reason.
Maybe this one should have been named: &quot;You can go there, but not any farther.&quot; You&apos;ll understand when you get to this geocache that is located in Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park alongside Rend Lake.

You can approach this geocache from two different roads. It should be an easy find from either direction, but be careful during hunting seasons, as the adjoining areas are sometimes used by hunters.

Let&apos;s not forget to give a word of thanks to the cache-friendly folks at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (www.stateparks.com/wayne_fitzgerrell.html) and the nice people at Rend Lake Resort (www.rendlakeresort.com).

We ran out of daylight before seeing all of the park but we did get to see the sun setting across the lake to finish out a wonderful day. 
Thanks for bringing us here.

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4915. (52 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

4:20 pm

I had to be in Shumway today at 4:00 pm. However, as soon as I arrived I was informed that I was given the wrong time and to come back in an hour.

What to do....what to do?

Oh...I know..geocaching! That&apos;s always fun! This was the nearest cache for me so I headed out to find it. On the way I found myself in some semi-familiar territory. It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve been out here, so it was cool to finally get back.

It took a little looking. The GPS pointed me about 15 feet in one direction and the cache was in the other. After a brief search I found it.

The logsheet was full. I added a strip of National Geographic Adventure Paper and replaced the cache where I found it. Thanks!

This is on privet property.  So as always when GEOCACHING be respectful .  You only have permission to look for the cache only.  You must approch from the west.  And if it has been raining or muddy stay on the gravel, but out of the oil pumper?s way.

 This cache contains some small tread stuff.

There is a Legend about this area few people know about. During the Civil War the Federal Prison at Alton, Illinois housed thousands of Confederate soldiers. and the living conditions were deplorable. During one of the Smallpox outbreaks the sick Troopers were moved to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River.  As the men died they were moved from the island by boat, loaded onto a wagon and taken to an open field that was to be their final resting place.  The Union soldiers assigned to the burial detail were the worst of the Guards that were assigned to the Prison, and as such did not perform their duties to the best of their abilities.  These soldiers were known to simply dump the bodies along the road that ran through the woods up to the Cemetery.  Then they would break out the Whiskey and cards, passing the time until the detail was over.  After the War, skeletal remains were found from time to time and given a proper burial, but no one really knows how many bodies were left in those woods alone to meet their grisly end.  The legend continues that one night in October a young man whose name has vanished over time, was driving home, as he passed by the woods he saw a skinny older looking man with his thumb out, hitchhiking along the side of the road.  Feeling sorry for the man he stopped and offered him a ride, the man who appeared to be wearing some type of old tattered uniform, got into the car, and sat not speaking as the man drove off into the night. As they drove the man attempted to talk to his passenger but the old man simply sat looking forward, not making a sound.  as they got closer to the young mans turn off, he looked over at his mysterious passenger and was shocked to see the seat was EMPTY!! the old man had vanished into thin air!!  The young man sped off into the night, passing the old Confederate Cemetery on his way home.
Hint: do this one at night... IF YOU DARE!!

After wandering up and down the road in all directions, with my gps obviously napping, this one finally popped up on stlouis-geo-cacher&apos;s radar!   Signed the log and it was replaced exactly where found.  TFTC!

2009-11-14 stlouis-geo-cacher, 12:55pm - Out geocaching with a friend geenerwee and to be honest, both of our GPS&apos;s couldn&apos;t decide where WE were let alone where to find the cache. But after several attemps, and 20 minutes later, mine finally had me at the exact cordinance and I located in only a minute of looking.

Found it
2009-08-04 Thoslolly, My brother had told me where this cache was when we drove by but his is the first time I tried to find it.  Spent a half hour trying to find it and I had looked right at it several times but didn&apos;t notice it.  Several cars kept going by.  Kept hiding everytime a car went by so I wouldn&apos;t be noticed.

2009-11-14 Hobbit Taz, Out with CribbageWitch for the nearby WWFM today.  The cache apparently was not in its original location by the clue, but close enough we found it relatively easy.  The park was found to be in need of more care especially in this part of the park.  Also we felt very unsafe during our search.  Lots of cursing, yelling, and screeming across the road.    Hope nobody ended up injured especially the children that were in the cursing as much as the parents.    
Thanks for the cache, but at least today it did not put a good view on your park or community.
Found it
2009-11-14 CribbageWitch, OCW Hobbit Taz while in town for WWFM. This was not too hard a find, but the fighting and cursing across the street was a bit unnearving!!!  I truly fear or the children in the household.  The adults and older children were truly abusing each other and the smaller children horribly.  I would love to see some sort of interention to keep those kids safe.  The park needs a lot of TLC and the glass on the steps could be quite dangerous.
Write note
2009-11-14 myotis, I started looking for this one.  The parents and kids were fist fighting, cursing, screaming, yelling, etc.  It was not a good place to be.  So I left after looking a couple of minutes.  With the distrurbance going on across the street, it did not seem safe.  Talking to people at the event it sounds like they were going at it for a very long time.  I was going to go look after dark after the event.  But I was told it was an unsafe neighborhood.  So I did not.  One time in Union MO someone got murdered at a picnic table I sat at a few hours earlier after finding a cache.  That was weird enough.  I sure hope no one got hurt or killed with all the violiance going on.  If I had a cell phone, I would have called the cops.
Found it
2009-11-14 fishin&apos;buds, 2009 Five of seven, Not so easy P &amp; G. Took a second look to locate.  Locals down the hill were loudly cursing  and when the glass started breaking we got out of there.  Wouldn&apos;t go there after dusk that&apos;s for sure.  Picking up a couple before heading home after the Wacky Hat Flashmob in Murphysboro today. With Equil and PePe65.   Nice hide made us work for it.
Didn&apos;t find it
2009-11-07 TsukiakariUsagi, So today was a journey to break a lot of personal records... 1 day, 1 city, 31 caches bookmarked, 9 hours of daylight (8:15am - 5:15pm)... After it was all said and down, there were 23 total attempts at caches, 17 of those were found, 4 were DNF&apos;s, and 2 were noted due to various circumstances. The following is a story of one of those caches:
-----
This was my twenty-third and final cache for the day... I forgot how quickly it gets dark in the fall once the sun sets behind the horizon.  It&apos;s definitely not the long and drawn out sunsets of the summer for sure.  I&apos;ll have to come back here when I complete the last of my Murphysboro city limit caches and when there&apos;s actual daylight out.

2009-10-15 maleki, Just a few days or a week before some better fall colors but we really enjoyed a few caches in the really nice state park today.  Cruising south thru eastern IL in the dreary misty rain today.  This was one of the more enjoyable stops along the way.   TFTC!  Nicely done!  Thought about camping here but it was a bit too early in the afternoon.  Spotted a conservation office/park ranger while passing thru and got some advice about other state parks and conservation areas to the south.  Had us stop by the park office for a couple brochures about other areas.  Very helpful.

After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

This cache container ( M258A1decon unmodified, with a Mindbinder Log Book) was a 40 Wedding anniversary present from ZBQ.  Thus when searching for this cache, the searcher must keep that in mind.  In other words ?There ain?t no hint no way?.  I do hope this proves to be something other than a quick grab.  Oh yea please put it back as you found it.  And most of all have fun with this one.
One more thing, there is a small box wit a log, very near by, this is not the cache, any log the this one, needless to say,  will be deleted.

SIZE: Micro
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: You are looking for a micro cache container located north of the former White City Park.
This Bit of History on Marion County brings you to the area one of us grew up;  now going by the name of Central City. Back in 1830 the first settler, Enoch Holtslaw took up residence on the banks of the Crooked Creek at the northern edge of Central City. At its zenith, the town and immediate surroundings contained about 25 homes ? a thriving frontier community for its time.  The dreams of the Gainesville settlers were shattered with the announcement that the Illinois Central would locate its railroad line to the west of their village.  Thus the birth of Central City heralded the passing of Gainesville. The abandoned cemetery includes those original family names.

The first store didn?t come until 1852 opened by Madison Howell.  At this time;  Central City was to be the center of the IC railroad, as the water supply from the nearby creek would be a necessary for the operation.  But railroad representatives and 2 speculators couldn?t reach an agreement on land prices, so they decided instead upon moving on down the tracks to establish its shops and gave birth to Centralia. In 1854, Central City had 300 inhabitants and construction was booming.  Established businesses included: a hotel at N.W. corner Broadway/Hardin, newspaper, post office.  In 1855, a tin shop, brewery, steam-powered flour mill, carpentry shop were here and a school was built in the vicinity of the present school. 

In the fall of 1858, the state fair provided a great deal of excitement for Central City, as it hosted this event on 30 acres west of town and north of Green Street.  There was quite a bit of rivalry between Central City and Centralia in those days.  Central City with the fair held top hand during the day, but Centralia with huge bonfires, bands and speakers held sway at night.  This being a country district;   hundreds camped in tents and temporary structures, while the railroad provided sleeping cars on 2 ½ miles of siding and operated free trains twice daily to towns as distant as Decatur. Notable speakers included Abraham Lincoln arriving as a private passenger, while Stephen A. Douglas arrived in his private train car.  One incident at the fair received more notoriety than any other;  a hot air balloon ride with 2 young children got away from those holding the ropes. The area was alerted by telegraph and railroad in every direction, as well as the newspaper the following morning, to be on the look-out.  All that day the search continued and by night the report came that they were located. The children were recovered 18 miles S.E. of their home in Jefferson County. This story even found its way in the pages of Sanders Union Reader Number Three and immortality, titled ?A Thrilling Incident?.

   Later, during the Civil War this same fairgrounds area was used as a military camp.  It was a temporary location for troops awaiting shipment on the Illinois Central to and from the front, as well as for men on furlough.

The Niemann Store, was located across Green Street from the present day Senior Center,was a tradition from about 1890, with St. Louis news coverage before it?s closing as one of the last stores to sell a wide variety of goods, just as in the ?olden days?. My own experiences included a daily candy stop on the way to school each day, while wondering why a horse yoke was hanging in this store. For those of us who enjoy finding the places ?less traveled? we hope you have enjoyed this walk down memory lane.

Fortunately there was light traffic and the shoulder is wide near the cache, so we were able to park near the cache instead of hiking in from farther away.

Cache ID: GC17QFN
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: This micro can be found at the above posted coordinates, so you will have to use your imagination to understand the name but hopefully not to find the cache.
When this caching team was still in their youth the intersection near this cache looked much different, thus the name of the cache.  Locals used the term, out past the Y regularly.  A church, the United Presbyterian Church of Romine Prairie, formed in another location in 1823 then was moved here in 1894 facing the east.  As the road from the west approached, it allowed you to easily travel north to Salem or south to Dix by dividing in both directions, thus giving it a Y toward the church.  The church was not moved until the 1980?s receiving one known mishap by two intoxicated oilfield workers in a large truck, who could not make either choice in time, ran into the church building causing extensive damage to the church.  This same building was moved within sight just a short distance north.  
We hope you have enjoyed this Bit of History as we step back into the past of Marion county.

Cache ID: GC17PY4
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: 
This cache is located in Wild Woman country.  From the time that I was a youngster, which was a long time ago, I heard stories about a wild woman who supposedly lived in this area.  When I was on a tractor or traversing alone in that area, I always kept my eyes peeled for her.  Up to this time, I have not seen her, but some of the locals still hear her scream at night.  A few years back when I was eating lunch at Moonshine, I asked one of the locals if he had ever seen the wild woman.  He answered no, but he had heard her many times.  He said he would hear her when he was coon hunting.  I asked him if she scared him.  He said no, but he always had to quit hunting because it would scare the dogs so bad that they would come back to him and every time he would take a step one of the dogs would be between his legs.  LOL.  The area is on a small gravel road, so pull off the road when you look for the cache.  There is plenty of room.  The ground is in my family, so you will not be trespassing.  By the way, if you do see the wild woman, please let me know.  She should be old enough now that she needs to be in a nursing home! The cache is a lock and lock storage camo. container with a $2.00 bill for first time finder and it contains a travel bug to be moved on south.

This a 2 only because you will need to walk to it.
The old first stage got muggled (broken)
The unmowed portion of the woods behind the West Porterville Church belongs to the Eastern Illinois Sportsman?s Club, you have permission to go in after the cache.  The New &quot;NO TRUSPASSING&quot; sign is for liability, they are not to be held responsible in case of accidents, just like any other cache site.

This is in the West Porterville Church yard,  I attend here, and usually park right by the first stage.  So if you are there on Sunday, come on in, you will not meet any more friendly folks.  24/7 - But Sunday morning services, are 9:30 Sunday School, 10:30AM Church, Sunday evening services are 6:30PM &amp;  Wednesday @ 6:30PM, so be respectful.  Youth meet at 5:30PM Sunday Have FUN.

What is
   It?

A glacial erratic is a piece of rock that is not native to the
area, but was delivered there by glacial ice. The erratic differs
from the sizes and types of rocks in the area in which it rests.
They can vary in size from light pebbles to tens of thousands of
tons. 

Where are They?

Randomly found throughout Illinois are boulders lying alone or with
others in the corner of a field or someone&apos;s yard, on a courthouse
lawn or a schoolyard. Many are colorful and glittering granites, or
banded gneisses, and some have intricately veined and streaked
patterns in igneous and metamorphic rocks. They may seem out of
place in the grassy knolls and prairies of our state. Their
&quot;erratic&quot; occurrence is the reason for their interesting name. 

Where Did They Come From?

These exotic, erratic, rocks came from the North: Canada and the
states north of us. The continental glaciers of the Great Ice Age
scraped the land surface as they moved down the continent, pushing
up chunks of bedrock and grinding them against each other or the
ground surface. Sometimes you can tell where the erratic originally
came from by determining the kind of rock it is. 

Granite, gneiss, or other igneous or metamorphic rock large
boulders may have come from Canada.
Those with flecks of copper were probably transported here from
the &quot;Copper Range&quot; of the upper peninsula of Michigan.
Light gray to white quartzite boulders with round pebbles of
red jasper came from Ontario, Canada.
Purplish pieces of quartzite, some with bands, probably
originated in Wisconsin.
Glacial till and is unsorted and unlayered mixture of clay,
sand, gravel that vary widely in size and shape that produced
Canadian Tillite. This glacial till has been around so long that it
has hardened into a gray to greenish gray rock containing a mixture
of grains of different sizes and scattered pebbles of various types
and sizes


Uses

Many erratics are of notable size and beauty. Some are used as
monuments in courthouse squares and parks, or along highways. Many
are marked with metal plaques to indicate an interesting historical
spot or event. 

Logging Requirements

What is a Spring?

A spring is formed when the side of a hill or some other excavation
crosses flowing ground water which is at or below the water table.
A spring results from an aquifer filled to the point that the water
overflows onto the surface. The springs may range in size from
small seeps that flow occasionally after a large rainfall to huge
pools pouring forth hundreds of millions of gallons daily. 

How Does a Spring Form?

Springs form in rock. Some of the largest springs are formed in
limestone and dolomite. Both dolomite and limestone fracture or
crack relatively easily. Rainwater seeps through the ground
undergoing a chemical change forming a weak carbonic acid which
then enters these cracks and dissolves the rock. When the water
reaches a horizontal crack or a layer of non-dissolving rock such
as sandstone or shale, it begins to move sideways, forming an
underground stream. Eventually this can form a large opening, or
cave and may take tens to hundreds of thousands of years to
complete. 

How Much Water Flows?

The amount of water that flows from springs depends on many things.
The size of the caverns in the rock, the water pressure of the
aquifer, the size of the spring basin, and the amount of rainfall.
Human activities also influence the amount of water that comes from
a spring. Groundwater withdrawals in an area can reduce the
pressure and water levels in an aquifer, decreasing the flow from
the spring. 

Is the Water Hot or Cold?

The temperature of the water depends on the temperature of the
rocks it is passing through, and how long it travels before
surfacing. For example, the temperature of an Ozark spring comes
from its passing through rock at an average temperature of 56 F.
But on the other hand, thermal springs, such as in the bubbling mud
springs in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, occur in regions of
recent volcanic activity and are fed by water heated by contact
with hot rocks far below the surface.

 
Legends

According to the local Kaskaskia tribes, these waters had healing
powers that could cure a multitude of ailments including gout,
consumption, or lumbago, and would leave a payment of flint, bone,
or pottery in thanks for their health. Today, recent visitors often
leave coins after taking a drink of the Waupun - The Water That
Heals.

Magnificent Muggle

The landowner is a wonderful gentleman by the name of Paul. He says
that he gets as much pleasure out of folks visiting his little
spring as we do visiting it. He also would enjoy talking to any
geocachers who want to know anything about the spring and
surrounding area, or Fayette County in general! If you have time
for a chat, Paul will meet you there, 
contact me and I&apos;ll email you his phone number, he&apos;d love it.
When you do visit, he only asks that you CITO.

Logging Requirements

In order to log this cache, determine the following and email me
the answer. DO NOT post your answer in your
log.

1.Determine the flow rate of the spring in the SI unit (cubic
meters per second)

In addition, DO Post in your log:

2. The temperature of the spring water at the time of your
visit

3. Post a picture of you with your gpsr near the fountain.

We arrived at the cache site, and two muggles were sitting at the picnic table right next to the spring. By the looks of the beer they had to drink, they were going to stay a while. We took our picture, drank some water, dropped some coins, measured the outflow, and then went to find the cache that was hidden nearby. Email has been sent. The water temperature was in the mid 50s.

Cache is located in an area few may be aware of. In 1897 a French immigrant named Benjamin Biszant built a Castle like structure he named Lakeview for his English Bride.  He purchased a large tract of land near Hartford, Illinois, brought in men with teams of horses to help move earth to form moats around his Castle.  The grounds around the  home had several turrents, gardens, and a Gazebo.  The home itself consisted of 14 rooms with floors made from imported Cypress wood.  The home was very elegeant for the times and the area.  Sadly Benjamins wife died, and he lost interest in the home after taking his wife back to England for burial.  The home had a colorful history, being used as a Military School, and a home for unwed mothers.  During the 1920&apos;s it was rumored to have been a Speakeasy, with the bootleg liquor brought in by the infamous Shelton Brothers.  Over time the home was vanalized and finally returned back to nature.  If you want to read further about the home go to www.Prairieghosts.com, I believe there is a story about it in Weird Illinois.  This is a Multi-cache that will take you to several spots that are still standing so don&apos;t forget to bring your camera! Final is a small tube with just enough room for the log, sign small and tweezers would come in handy.  We hope everyone enjoys this cache as much as we enjoyed placing it.  There are 2 waypoints and then the Final, WP-1 will take you to a large structure that we think may have been a well it is at 38N48.010-090W05.039.

2009-12-19 L Frank, We had some extra time this afternoon to do a special cache that has been on our list for a while. So we decided to do this cache this afternoon. Not knowing what to expect, we took our walking sticks with us. Glad we did. The water in the moat was higher than expected, and we had to walk across the makeshift bridge. We used our walking sticks as support as we balanced on the narrow logs. We found WP1 right near the water&apos;s edge, and the gazebo was surrounded by water also. We took some pictures of the fish pond, but didn&apos;t see the statue. We went up to the house ruins, but the only thing recognizable was the well in back. After a little searching, we finally found the final, but a larger container could have been hidden close by. Followed the sidewalk down to the water&apos;s edge, where it looked like there may have possibly been a boat dock. The sidewalk takes you around the area where the house once stood and down to the outbuilding, which was possibly some type of garage or stable? Thanks, RadioactiveGrl and Medic161, for bringing us here.

Visiting family this holiday.  Now call Ohio home.  The cache is in good shape and plenty of room left on the log.  I was worried on the last phase, I thought what b*astid would put a tiny micro in a pile of old cinder blocks, Then I I braced myself I found it..  Cleaver hide.  Earthcat and yendor was with us for the trek.  Tossed a few more logs on the makeshift bridge.  If you aren&apos;t nimble you may want to pass this geocache or at least go on a day when everything is frozen solid.  I&apos;ll bet it is fun during mosquito season as well.

2009-10-18 lake_wannabees, As we drove up on this one we spotted a car in a wonderful little parking spot but no one to be seen.  Had to think it was a cacher since we were so close to this one.  Sure enough right after we got out of car Dutchboy came out of the woods assuring us that the cache was still there.  Into the woods we went and made this one number 25 of 52 today to celebrate our first Cache Slash Fest weekend.
Found it
2009-10-18 DutchBoy, I was not able to attend the 2009 Cache Slash Fest this year because I had to work, but it was such a beautiful day today, I decided to head over that way and find some of the new caches that had been place for the event.
thanks for hiding this cache.  This was my last cache of the day.  As I was coming out of the woods, I met a couple of other geocachers heading for this cache.  I assured them that it was still there.
thanks

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T3.0
DESC: Located along the road with overview of the Ohio River.
Cache placed to help those Kentucky DeLorme Challenge competitors who don&apos;t like the city life. 

Buffalo must have roamed this range many years ago.

Road going to and from this cache could be muddy at times. The car wash businesses need more visitors so this should help them out. 

Located along the road, overlooking the Ohio River just across from Mt. Vernon, Indiana. 

Cache will not be accessable during flood season. DO NOT pass any road closed signs to attempt to get to this cache.

Water crosses the southern road to the cache at 31 feet.

Check the river flood stage at the following address...

Cache ID: GC186XH

SIZE: Small
D2.0/T1.5
DESC: This is a quick cache, just off IL State Hwy 150, East of Chester,
in Southern Illinois. It should take less than 30 minutes and is
largely handicapped accessible.
You may have poor reception in the area of the cache. So, this
cache has been set up as two types . . . an offset and a
regular.
This gives you TWO options to locate the cache, both options
lead to the same place 
OPTION ONE (Offset) The posted coordinates are for Waypoint 1,
where I had an EPE of 9&apos;. From Waypoint 1, you will travel
approximately 65&apos; on a bearing of 007 Degrees. Thanks to Gubbie and
Kid Dylan for helping me cache the error in my ways. (grin)
OPTION TWO (Regular - If OPTION ONE does not make sense) The
cache is located at Waypoint 2, where I had an EPE of 17&apos;.
Between the two, you should have little difficulty locating this
cache, which is accessible to most handicapped cachers. You are
looking for a small cache, with log, pencil and small trade items.
There is room for pins, geocoins and small TB&apos;s.
The &apos;Bridge To Nowhere&apos; is &quot;Mary&apos;s River Covered Bridge.&quot; There
is a two sided informational sign located nearby. The side with
information on the bridge is easily readable;  the side with
Chester-Kaskaskia information is faded and barely legible, however,
it shows up very nicely with flash. The text from both sides and
pictures of both sides are below.
&quot;Built in 1854, in continuous service from 1854-1930. Was
originally part of a planked toll road between Breman and Chester.
All of the timber in the bridge is the original with the exceptions
of the floor, floor joist, roof and siding. Aquired by the State of
Illinois in 1936 for purposes of preservation and a picnic area.
Money for the purchase of the site was donated by Chester Chamber
of Commerce.&quot;




 
&quot;Chester--Kaskaskia, Illinois
Shadrach Bond, first governor of Illinois (1818-1822), is buried
in Evergreen Cemetery in Chester. The first recorded settler in the
area was John McFerron who purchased land in 1817 buy Samuel Smith,
who settled here in 1830, is considered the founder of Chester.
Formerly known as Smith&apos;s Landing, the community was renamed after
Chester, England. The town was a river port for the export of such
local products as castor oil, flour and meat during the
mid-nineteenth century it became the county seat in 1848 and was
incorporated as a city in 1855. 
Kaskaskia, founded in 1703 as a Jesuit Mission, became a
prominent French village. During the French and Indian War
(1754-1763) between France and Britain, Fort Kaskasia was erected
on the bluffs near the settlement. By Treaty of Paris in 17?3,
Kaskaskia came under British control. On July 4, 1778 George Rogers
Clark captured the Kaskaskia Settlement and the area became part of
Virginia. Kaskaskia served as Illinois Territorial Capital
(1809-1818) and as the first state capital (1818-1820). when the
capital was moved to Vandalia, Kaskaskia declined in importance.
Mississippi floods from 1844 to 1910 gradually destroyed the old
settlement, and the area is now Fort Kaskaskia State
Park.
Sites of interest include the Garrison Hill Cemetery containing
a monument to the pioneers;  the home of Pierre Menard, first
Lieutenant Governor, which is preserved as a state memorial and the
Kaskaskia State Memorial on Kasksakia Island containing the Liberty
Bell of the West.&quot; 


George Rogers Clark Campsite

In the third year of the American Revolutionary War, Lt.
Colonel George Rogers Clark and his army of 170 Virginians set out
from Fort Massac (Metropolis) on their way to liberate the town of
Kaskaskia from British control. On July 3, 1778, Clark&apos;s army
crossed the old state ford near Welge and established its fifth and
final camp on the West side of St. Mary&apos;s River. 
On July 4th Clark&apos;s Army marched to a staging point at
Diamond Cross and later that evening attacked and secured
Kaskaskia.

Additional WaypointsND186XH - Waypoint 2N 37° 56.902 W 089° 45.954This is the final Waypoint.  It was set up this way in the event you poor reception near the final, you can do this as an offset cache from Waypoint 1.

To log this cache, you must post a picture of yourself near the cache location. Try to get some cattle in the picture as many are usually in the proximity.

After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

I have had people e-mail me to tell me I need to replace the pencil in a cache... I always take things along like you did so I can repair a cache for the owner..sometimes it keeps the cache from being Archive..

Thanks again..

SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T2.5
DESC: This is a trucker friendly cache. The area is fairly flat.
Bushwacking involved in summertime, long pants is a must. Geotrail
invisible. Above coordinates are for parking from there you can
walk to the cache.
For this cache you will need access to Ten-Codes. They can be found
at the following website:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-code 
Ten-Codes were developed by Charles Hooper;  a Communications
Director at the Illinois State Police, District 10 in Urbana in the
1940&apos;s. They were used to reduce speak on the police radios. It was
later adapted by CB radio users.
From the text below you will find the coordinates to the cache.
Look for the word in &quot; &quot; and match them with the ten-codes from the
web site above.
Have fun good buddy.
{Make sure you aren&apos;t a &quot;suspicious vehicle&quot;. Park at the above
coordinates or a &quot;tow truck might be needed&quot;. Get ready the cache
&quot;chase will begin&quot;. Be &quot;careful&quot;. This cache should be easy;  not a
&quot;bomb&quot;. A tiny &quot;wrecker is needed&quot; to reveal the loot. For this
&quot;location&quot; use &quot;caution&quot;.}

I think my son and I looked for this one in the dark last Thanksgiving weekend, but we were looking about 20 feet away from where we should have been.

2009-07-01 guillermospapa, On the last day of our mini-vacation, team Guillermospapa left the St. Louis area for Springfield and some time at the Lincoln museum.  Anytime we are hitting a new area, Papa likes to work a puzzle in.  So, on the way we hit this cache.  A few steps into the search, Papa remembered that this was the cache that stated &quot;long pants a must&quot;.  Thankfully,  Guillermo didn&apos;t follow Papa into the jungle lest he, too, suffer multiple lacerations from the blood-thirsty thorns.   Having autographed the log, Papa retreated to the rest stop to care for his wounds.  TFTC![:D]

2009-06-19 Wheelinb, We grabbed this on our way to Chicago. I solved this one so long ago and had just not had the chance to grab it. I did the research at work and e-mailed it to myself. I keep a list of all the puzzles I solve but for some reason I did not put this one on there. Javapgmr sent me the solution and right about the time he did I found it in my e-mail. It was difficult finding a good way in but once back a little bit there was a well defined geotrail.

Good thing, the weeds were up to my belt and the thorns were bad too.  This was a very tough bushwhack back to the spot.  Made a quick find and had to climb back out.  Much easier in the winter I&apos;ll bet

2009-05-12 racer2814, Was headed down to Clarksville, TN for something much more important than caching but I found out he would be released from the hospital before I got there. Since I was about 20 mi. south of Effingham I decided not to waste the trip. Ran a query and decided to grab some caches heading to Cahokia Mounds. 

I left so early this morning that after a great visit to Cahokia Mounds there was plenty of day left to grab some other caches.

Took a bit of a detour to grab this one. Quite a bushwhack too. Orale! and TFTC.

2009-08-25 Gerhardus, What a day!!! Brawny Bear, Happykraut and I drove 3 hrs to meet up with Mike Anderson1492 for a little geocaching. We had over 200 caches on our list but we wondered just how many we could do. I&apos;m thinking we stopped at almost 150+ caches and logged about 140. This shattered my old personel best of 57. Great day and great company. Brawny managed to squeak over 5000.  What a day indeed! TFTC!!

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4893. (30 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

2009-07-26 thecokers, We liked how this one was decently close to town... and also thought it was pretty easy. However, we find that the size of the cache is more towards &apos;small&apos; than &apos;micro&apos;... just comparing it to the others we have found today. Also, just a note that the lid was EXTREMELY difficult to pry open... so we are hoping that since we finally got it to- that it won&apos;t be so hard for the next person. The other items we found in the cache was a purple square gem, a blue &apos;tear-drop&apos; gem, and a magnet with a bone on it! Cool! [:D]

Cache ID: GC1AA8V
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.0/T1.5
DESC: Along the right of way of a county road.  Short walk, not too difficult.
This is a traditional cache in a sealed container approximately 3&quot; in diameter and 16&quot; long, that is hidden along the public right of way of a county road.

Years ago, across the road to the South from the cache location stood a huge two-story brick house.  The pond, which was constructed in the 50?s, came to be known as the ?Brick House Pond?.  Even though the house has been gone for more than 50 years, all the older local residents (myself included) of the area still refer to this pond as the ?Brick House Pond?.  
In the late 60?s and early 70?s, a large portion of the pond was filled in for the rerouting of the county road due to the construction of I-57.

Note that this cache IS NOT accessible from I-57.  Please make sure the cache is returned to it?s original location, and that the container is securely closed.  Thanks.

I solved it once and when I searched my gmail for the solution to &quot;Re-Morsed&quot; that I _knew_ I had emailed to myself  the search came up empty. That was because I had copied the spelling from the cache page so after I solved it again (the last bits took a while as I couldn&apos;t quite remember what I had done before) I remembered the cache name had an extra &apos;e&apos;. Anyway, really fun puzzle, well done! Thanks for the fun!

DESC: A quick park and grab with a great view of the Chester Bridge over
the Mississippi River, a portion of the Missouri Mississippi Valley
and maybe a bit of Kaskaskia Island (the only part of Illinois,
WEST of the Mississippi River!)

This scenic view is located along a one-way street behind the
County Court House in Chester, IL. Follow the signs to the
Sheriff&apos;s Department to get on the correct street. Just north of
the cache seems to be where the smokers in the courthouse hangout,
so some discretion is advised.
The cache is a micro with log and pencil. 100 sets of
coordinates, with an EPE (Estimated Position Error) of about 11&apos;
were averaged for this cache.
There are several other caches located in, and near, Chester. Be
sure to check them out.

After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

2009-11-07 How-D, I THINK we solved the puzzle correctly to get the coordinates.  The coordinates took us to an area that looked like a logical spot for a geocache.  It was a pretty location.  But after 30 minutes of searching, we gave up.  Oh well.

Had a nice walk around the area on a beautiful day though.

2009-10-04 BlueBeadMan, I was on my way to teaching sixth grade camp but 2_cats wanted to grab a couple caches before I left for the week.  Who am I to turn down that opportunity?  We grabbed just a couple, but it was still a fun day.  We grabbed this cache and another one before calling it a day.  Thanks!  [:)]  TNLNSL--Thanks again for the cache!

2008-11-30 myotis, This one was hard to find-took about an hour.  Not an easy place to seach for a micro this time of the year.  It was getting dark and I was just about to give up when I spotted it.

Got out this afternoon and cleared the 5 caches closest to home.  Got some good exercise.  Thanks.

2008-11-01 GreenCachers, Having solved this some time ago it was just a matter of having an excuse to head up this way to log the find. As the weather was so good today, we set off for some hiking in the area and stopped by to grab the cache. The final was very busy, likely due to the wonderful weather, and we waited for the right moment to move in. The cache was safely tucked away in its home and we signed the log and returned it. Thanks for all the puzzles.

Cache ID: GC1AQDW
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T3.0
DESC: This cache is located in the Washington County Conservation Area. It is a few steps off the 7 mile loop of the Washington County Conservation Area Trail.
This cache was placed by a group of Scouters&apos; who are all cachers. The cache is a good size rubbermaid container. The cache was started with all kinds of good swag. I have place this one in the hope to get people to do a little hiking associated with visiting this beautiful Conservation Area! Absolutely awesome trail.  This hike could easily be done with children of age 10 and older. Depending on where you park will depend on the length of you hike. I will post coordinates at a later time for two different parking areas (Shady Rest Camping Area &amp; Hunter Parking areas closest to cache). Warning during times of extensive rain, there is parts of the trail that could be under water. No worries cache is always safe! Please put back in a concealed manner.

Don&apos;t forget to cache in and trash out!

2009-09-13 myotis, While I did not find the cache, this was an outstanding hike.  I came in the long way (3 mile round trip) and GPSed that part of the trail.  I spent about 45 minutes there looking for it.  There has been burning, tree cutting, and clearing at ground zero.  So I hiked back.  Then I decided I wanted to GPS more of the trail.  So after I got back to the showerhouse parking, I started following the trail in my car-wow almost all of it is on the road shoulder (made it easy to add to my trail map).  Then I found the other approach to the cahce.  So I hiked and GPSed from that way.  It was much shorter but not as nice of a hike.  I looked for another 15 minutes.  But no luck.  I think it may be gone.  

Decided to do some cachinhg today.  I had planned on going much further South and doing lots more caches.  But I liked the first two places I went today (Washington COunty Nature Preserve and Washington County Conservation Area) I spent all day there and just found 3 caches. I had a really great time and got to do some hiking in really nice areas.  I also got to GPS a bunch of stuff for my trail  map.  So thnaks for the outstanding caches!  One thing I liked aobut both places was they are obviously regualarly burned and I did not see many invassive and some very high forest.  I get so tired of seeing the invassive jungles around the STL area.

It has been a cold winters morning and my brother and I have encountered many a wild beast on our treacherous quest to finding the mythical lost Cache of Washed Away Hike. We toiled for nearly forty minutes until at last, we found what we have only dreamed of...the lost treasure of Washed Away Hike. A little advice, wear clothes that can get muddy. Awesome cache and awesome concept. We will continue to search for Geocaches and hopefully be creating one from both of us. If and when you do find this cache, please...enjoy the Carmex!

2008-09-20 geenerwee, WARNING:  MAY CONTAIN SPOILER.  
We camped at Shady Rest in June and attempted a couple of times during our stay to find this cache...Once from a road off of 127 (where the gps kept leading), and again on the hiking trail from Shady Rest camping area by the cabin.  No luck.  Well, we came back to this nice state park in Sept.  Attempted again by hitting the trail from the Shady Rest shower house area.  Finally, after almost an hour of hiking, my gps showed within 450 feet!  I was so excited thinking I was going to be able to find it, that I headed off the path into some soggy long grass and lots of prickly branches as the distance counted down.  I was called back to the trail by my husband and geopup - who are not fond of snakes.  Unfortunately, I must log this one as a dnf.  The hiking trail is nice, but sometimes can get a little confusing.  I also now know what it feels like to have chiggers or mites, or whatever has invaded my ankles!  lol  Hats off to everyone who has found this one and definately to the owner of the cache!    :-D
UPDATE:  It&apos;s been a few days since we made the trek through the woods for this one and I just want to warn fellow cachers to take all necessary precautions against the chiggers/turkey mites!  The blisters are still showing up on our bodies.  The ankles were just the beginning.

2008-09-12 CrossCountryCachers, We are newbie cachers and haven&apos;t been hiking in years, so this was much more difficult than we expected. It was a lovely hike, indeed. Such a beautiful area. We are midwesterners living in Florida, so it was great being back in the woodlands. This would be glorious in the fall with the changing foliage. Took a Camp Joy scout patch, since hubby had gone there back in 1968. Left a snake. Wished we would have brought more supplies, like our hiking boots, walking stick, water, snack -- and that we would have sprayed down better. Got those mite things on the ankles. Also wished we would have researched parking areas first. Turns out, I think we did park at one of the closer areas. Still quite a walk to the site. Took us about an hour in, and an hour out. Thought we wouldn&apos;t find once there, but we percevered and were joyful! Good job on this great cache, Scouts!

2008-08-16 blackjeep1989, We made short work of this one by parking on the east side... took longer to get the turkey mites off of us that it took to get the cache... We suggest that you take a bath in Off before attempting this one. TFTC   Took TB

Welcome to an epicenter. On Friday, April 18,
2008 at 04:36 AM, Illinois and most of the midwest was awakened to
a rare Wabash Valley Earthquake measuring a magnitude of 5.2 on the
Richter Scale. The earthquake originated 7.2 miles below ground.
There has also been several aftershocks with one measuring 4.6 on
the Richter scale.

The following is a release by the United States Geological Survey,
National Earthquake Information Center: An earthquake occurred 35
km (20 miles) SW of Vincennes, Indiana and 205 km (125 miles) SW of
INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana at 3:36 AM MDT, Apr 18, 2008 (4:36 AM CDT in
Illinois). The magnitude and location may be revised when
additional data and further analysis results are available.





 Felt Reports 
Reports of minor structural damage in West Salem, Illinois and
Louisville, Kentucky. Felt over a wide area of the central United
States with felt reports as far west as Kansas, as far north as the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan and as far south as Georgia. 

 
 
 Tectonic Summary

 EARTHQUAKES IN THE WABASH VALLEY SEISMIC ZONE 
These earthquakes occurred in the Wabash Valley Seismic zone. The
earthquakes in this zone are scattered over a large area of
southeastern Illinois and southwest Indiana. The zone had at least
eight prehistoric earthquakes over the past 20,000 years with
estimated magnitudes ranging from about 6.5 to 7.5, based on
geologic evidence. Earthquakes of the size of the recent quake (Mw
5.2) can produce smaller aftershocks over the following days. A few
might be large enough to be felt. Typically, earthquakes of this
size (Mw 5.2) can cause light damage within a few tens of miles
from the epicenter. Central and eastern US earthquakes generally
shake areas about 10 times as large as those that occur in
California. It is not surprising that this earthquake was felt as
far south as Florida. 

The Wabash Valley Seismic zone is adjacent to the more seismically
active New Madrid seismic zone on the seismic zone&apos;s north and
west. The recent earthquake is also within the Illinois basin -
Ozark dome region that covers parts of Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois,
Missouri, and Arkansas and stretches from Indianapolis and St.
Louis to Memphis. Moderately frequent earthquakes occur at
irregular intervals throughout the region. The largest historical
earthquake in the Illinois Basin region (magnitude 5.4) damaged
southern Illinois in 1968. Moderately damaging earthquakes strike
somewhere in the region each decade or two, and smaller earthquakes
are felt about once or twice a year. 

Earthquakes in the central and eastern U.S., although less frequent
than in the western U.S., are typically felt over a much broader
region. East of the Rockies, an earthquake can be felt over an area
as much as ten times larger than a similar magnitude earthquake on
the west coast. A magnitude 4.0 eastern U.S. earthquake typically
can be felt at many places as far as 100 km (60 mi) from where it
occurred, and it infrequently causes damage near its source. A
magnitude 5.5 eastern U.S. earthquake usually can be felt as far as
500 km (300 mi) from where it occurred, and sometimes causes damage
as far away as 40 km (25 mi). 

 FAULTS Earthquakes everywhere occur on faults within
bedrock, usually miles deep. Most bedrock in the Illinois basin -
Ozark dome region was formed as several generations of mountains
rose and were eroded down again over the last billion or so years.


At well-studied plate boundaries like the San Andreas fault system
in California, scientists can often determine the name of the
specific fault that is responsible for an earthquake. In contrast,
east of the Rocky Mountains this is rarely the case. The Illinois
basin - Ozark dome region is far from the nearest plate boundaries,
which are in the center of the Atlantic Ocean, in the Caribbean
Sea, and in the Gulf of California. The region is laced with known
faults but numerous smaller or deeply buried faults remain
undetected. Even the known faults are poorly located at earthquake
depths. Accordingly, few earthquakes in the region can be linked to
named faults. It is difficult to determine if a known fault is
still active and could slip and cause an earthquake. As in most
other areas east of the Rockies, the best guide to earthquake
hazards in the Illinois basin - Ozark dome region is the
earthquakes themselves. 

 
 
 What is an earthquake? An earthquake is what happens when
two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface
where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location
below the earth?s surface where the earthquake starts is called the
hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of
the earth is called the epicenter. 
 

 Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller
earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake
that follows. Scientists can?t tell that an earthquake is a
foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main
earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have
aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur
afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the
size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months,
and even years after the mainshock!

 What causes earthquakes and where do they happen? The earth
has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and
crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on
the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece ?
it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of
the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly
moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each
other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges
of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries
are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the
world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are
rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving.
Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on
one of the faults and there is an earthquake.

 Why does the earth shake when there is an earthquake? While
the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block
is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide
past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving
blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the
fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The
energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the
form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves
shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach
the earth?s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like
our houses and us!

 
 The coordinates will take you to an
intersection closest to the epicenter of the 5.2 quake. Also the
center of the 4.6 aftershock is just 2 miles North near the same
road.

 To claim a log on this Earthcache:
1. Take your picture at the coordinates.

2. In your log please state if you felt the Earthquake on Apr. 18,
at 4:36 AM and how many miles away from this location were you at
the time?

 3. Email me with answers to the following questions within 3 days
of your log: DO NOT POST THESE IN YOUR LOG even if encrypted, Email
answers only.

 a. What is the elevation reading at the coordinates?
 b. Describe the topography around the epicenter(ie. flat?, hilly?,
rocky?, any creeks or streams nearby?, etc.)
 c. What is the difference between an epicenter and a
hypocenter?
d. What are the 3 types of &quot;shocks&quot; that can be felt.
e. Name the 2 Seismic Zones that affect Illinois.

If these requirements are not met your log will
be deleted.

2009-09-18 Wabaningo_Ranch, Thanks for an informative Earthcache.  I emailed all the answer required earlier for this cache.  I found this location on a Friday afternoon after a day of business in south-central Illinois.  I enjoyed learning about earthquakes as it is not a common topic of interest in Michigan.  I did not realize all the seismic activity south of this location in the New Madrid Seismic Zone.   

According to my office calendar I was in town that Friday morning, so I would be home in bed at that time.  Home is 347.11 mile away in Whitehall, Michigan.  I did not feel anything early that morning, however I am able to sleep through about anything.  May 31, 1998 I slept through our 1 in every 100 years rain storm with wind shears near 100 mph along the shores of Lake Michigan.  A huge oak tree toppled next to my bedroom and even that did not disturb my rest.

Woke up during the quake wondering if my neice had forgot her key and why she was shaking my window when she usually pounds on it!  Right at the end I realized it was  a quake.

I felt this quake in Saint Louis.  It woke me up from a sound sleep.  Initially I thought my drunk roommate was bounding his way down the hallway.  

I even felt the aftershock later that morning while sitting at my desk.

2009-04-10 racer2814, Despite what some people think due to the guideline change on ALR&apos;s, this does not affect Earthcaches and you must still fulfill the requirements stated for logging a find because there is no physical logbook at the location.

&quot;EarthCaches, remaining virtuals and remaining webcam caches are not affected by this guideline change. They do not have a physical container. They will continue to require some form of verification.&quot;

This Earthcache requires a photo and emailing me the answers to the questions.

Paco Moreno: Oh, you really break my heart, you know that? I&apos;m sorry about your old lady. I&apos;m sorry I didn&apos;t get to finish the job. 

Warden Bendix: One way or the other, I&apos;m going to get to the bottom of this. 

Mick O&apos;Brien: Hey. What are the odds on me now, Perretti? 
Perretti: Three to two... against you. Nothing personal. 

Paco Moreno: I lost my brother. All you lost was some skin. 

Gene Daniels: If you think you&apos;re hip, you&apos;re not. If you were you wouldn&apos;t be here. 

Horowitz: What are you afraid of? 
Mick O&apos;Brien: I ain&apos;t afraid of anything. 
Horowitz: Hey, after what you did to Viking and Tweety, you&apos;re IT! 

Mick O&apos;Brien: I killed your little brother, but he&apos;s dead because you didn&apos;t look after him.

We had a nice walk around the area, and then did a little CITO.  Thanks for bringing us to this area.

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

2009-08-22 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on an almost perfect day, weather-wise, in east central Illinois. We skipped doing this one last week and made it the first cache of the route this week. The “road” was passable and we made it to the cemetery without a problem. We looked in the usual places for the cache, but Mean Gene eyeballed it in a place that couldn&apos;t be reached by hand. It took a little wriggling and jiggling, but we got it slid into a more accessible spot and made the grab. We put it back so the next cacher should have no difficulty getting to it. TNLNSL. Thanks, king-of-halloween, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

2009-08-22 Mean Gene, Caching with Roelsch on a delightful day for caching in eastern Illinois.  This was our first cache of the day and we enjoyed the short hike from the car to the cache.  We all looked in the correct place but did not see it.  I eventually spotted it and wondered how I had missed it previously.  I went for my rooting pole to help push it out but did not get far before Roelsch had the cache on the ground.  Good job.

DESC: 
DO NOT GO TO THE POSTED COORDINATES!  This is not where the cache is located.  You will need to do some homework in order to figure this cache out.  Below I have listed quotes or hints to some songs from the 1980&apos;s.  You will need to figure out the names of the songs and who sang them so you can complete the puzzle.  There is a gold dollar for the First To Find prize.

A.  He says when is he gonna give us some room
    She says God I hope he comes back soon.

B.  Everyone&apos;s a Superhero.  Everyone&apos;s  a Captain Kirk 
    with orders to identify.  To clarify and classify.  
    Scramble in the summer sky.

C.  I&apos;ve got a job waiting for my graduation.
    50 thou a year... buys alot of beer.

D.  Four wheels scare the cockatoos from Kinotore East to 
    Yuendemer the western desert lives and breaths in  
    45 degrees.

E.  Got his first 6 string at the 5 and dime.  Played it
    till his fingers bled.

F.  This Paratrechina Longicornis had footwear issues.

G.  These 3 rockers got eliminated in 1983.  We aint     
    talking Nascar.  What were they driving?(2 digits only)

H.  How many times did the dinosaurs get walked?

OK, you should have 8 different numbers to work with.  Now you will need to do the math!!  Once you get this figured out use the answers you get to place in the correct blanks to get the coordinates.

A)  add 1 to your answer
B)  subtract 90 from your answer
C)  add 2 to your answer
D)  divide 4 into your answer
E)  subtract 61 from your answer
F)  subtract 0 from your answer
G)  subtract 28 from your answer
H)  subtract 4 from your answer

This should give you what you need to get the actual coordinates.  
   N38&apos; D 9 . A C G   W087&apos; H E . B 3 F
                

Email me before going out and I will let you know if the coords are correct before you take off looking for this one.  Have fun!!

Hint: If you have the correct coordinates you will find yourself at a cemetery.

2008-12-06 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene on our last trip to the Robinson, Lawrenceville area for awhile on a seasonably cold day with a few snow flurries, some overcast skies and some brief glimpses of sun – perfect geocaching weather! I didn&apos;t get answers for the last three questions, so I was out of luck. Mean Gene thought he had them all, but didn&apos;t spot the cache.

2009-07-03 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter (signing the logs as “MG/TR/RO”) in the Edwardsville area on a delightfully temperate summer&apos;s day, the start of the Independence Day weekend. We hiked to the coordinates and searched pretty thoroughly while The Rooter read the logs. The most recent log indicated that the cache was likely long gone, so we replaced it with a temporary – a 35mm film canister at the coordinates, nestled in a small grouping of protective rocks.

After parking, I rode the trail which felt like wet sand.  Finally, I got to GZ and I knew where to go.  Luckily, I saw it before I went further down the hill.  Thanks for the cache.

Post Reviewer Note
2009-12-14 ILReviewer, It appears that this cache has been disabled for quite some time.  Is it going to be replaced or should it be archived to make room for possible future caches? If the cache owner does not contact me by posting a note on this page by December 28, I&apos;ll assume the cache needs to be archived.

2009-08-10 dixie flier, After finding this cache, the cashier approached me and questioned what I was doing.   He said his manager (Kroger, I assume) knew nothing of the cache being there and it was to be removed for safty reasons.  I explained that it was not mine  and that we do not know each other so I surrendered it to him for safe keeping.  I think he was abit overzealous but that is just me. At any rate, you can retrieve it from him .  As for me----I feel totally deflated and do apoligize for the inconvenience.

DESC: The seventh of many puzzling caches in the St. Louis
area.
The coordinates above will not take you to the cache!!! 

The coordinates, however, is the closest legal parking to the
cache. This cache is not wheelchair-accessible and may be difficult
to get to after rain or snow. To find the coordinates for the
cache, you must solve the puzzle below. 


 

If you need help starting, send me a message. Hints will not be
given until after FTF has been logged. 

After completing the puzzle, place the numbers in the following
coordinates, based on the letters they represent. 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; N 38°
45.BFC
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; W 090° 12.IAC 
Once you have the coordinates, follow them to the cache.

This is the seventh of many puzzle caches to be placed in the St.
Louis area. If you want a preview of upcoming puzzles, pick up a
&quot;Variety Puzzles&quot; magazine from your local grocery store.

Permission to place this cache has been given by the land owners.
However, they ask that it only be searched during daylight
hours.

Congratulations to JanS03 for FTF! --&gt;

2009-11-25 BlueBeadMan, I had the day off work (teaching school) and 2_cats didn&apos;t.  Hmm, it appears it is time to do some caching.  Back in August, 2_cats went caching in North County.  She found a bunch of caches thinking that I had already found them.  Whoops!  I hadn&apos;t found them--so I found a most of them today by myself.  I also found some caches in Granite City and surrounding areas that 2_cats had previously found as well.  I guess you could say that this 4300+ cache finder needed to catch up to that 1900+ cache finder!  [:P]  Well, sortof--at least our area cache hunts will be a tad bit easier to figure out.  It was a good day to do some solocaching.  This was one of the cache finds I made today.  Thanks!  [:)]  TNLNSL--Thanks again for the cache!

Cache is intact after the storm, as mentioned before the Ziplock has multiple holes but contents are OK!!  Be advised that the cache is completely surrounded by poison Ivy at least 50 yds in all direction, after the long walk in we took the risk!!  If you attempt this cache make sure you take in a pen/pencil....  Not one in cache..... and mine was left in truck, DUH!!  Will return when the road opens up to finsh signing the logbook.  We did place Scooby-Doo stickers in logbook as our mark and left a TB for the next visitor.

Thanks for placing this cache, it made for some adventure!!

I went through the trailhead trying to get to the cache and ended up just blazing my own trail, and then when I went out, I headed towards the road and walked back that way, realized it was an easier way in.  [The hike was a lot of fun, especially the part when I was in a valley and realized I needed to be at the top to continue hunting for the cache.  When I got to the top, there was the cache, sitting out in the open like a treasure chest just waiting to be opened.  I went ahead and hid it in the same spot, but a little better than just out in the open.  TFTC!]

DESC: Some of our favorite people are here. What a serene place. Depending on the recent rainfall, this can be tricky to get to. Remember the important rule of never driving through water covering the road. At certain times of the year, water covering the road may be very deep with a fast current. And remember we never know when the road may be washed out under that water. DON&apos;T DO IT! That being said this is a beautiful area known by two names Rising Sun and Dogtown to the locals.
This is an ammo box starting out with 2 travel bugs and a geocoin along with other trinkets. On the day we placed it, we had to worry about four legged muggles. A doe jumped up and ran very close to us. We later discovered why. She was trying to get our attention away from her baby hidden in the underbrush. We totally respect nature and were careful not to scare them again.

I am placing this cache in honor of my grandparents, uncle and aunt
who are resting here. My aunt and uncle tombstone is not like the
traditional tombstones because they were unique. Also they couldn&apos;t
decide on what color it should be so on the tombstone you&apos;ll see
&quot;We couldn&apos;t agree in life either.&quot; 
My grandmother &apos;lived&apos; all of her 93 years, almost 94. Lived as in
she always said there was plenty of time to lay around later but
not enough time to get up and go somewhere. She died over a year
ago while taking her first helicopter ride to try to save her life.
I only got to spend five minutes with her on the last day of her
life before old age decided to catch up with her. There are not
many men that would cry for anyone but when news spread of her
death she got tears out of acouple of them. 
The cache is an ammo box filled with goodies to trade out, log
book and pen. If there is a relative that you want to dedicate the
finding of this cache please list his/her name underneath your log
and post on website.

DESC: Nice quiet place.  Leave things as they are and pick up trash if there is any please.  Some of these markers are very old so please watch were you step.
As posted by oldradioworld.com:

Blondie was a radio situation comedy adapted from the long-run Blondie comic strip by Chic Young. The radio program had a long run on several networks from 1939 to 1950. After Penny Singleton was cast in the title role of the feature film Blondie (1938), co-starring with Arthur Lake as Dagwood, she and Lake repeated their roles December 20, 1938, on The Bob Hope Show. The appearance with Hope led to their own show, beginning July 3, 1939, on CBS as a summer replacement for The Eddie Cantor Show. However, Cantor did not return in the fall, so the sponsor, Camel Cigarettes chose to keep Blondie on the air Mondays at 7:30pm. Camel remained the sponsor through the early WWII years until June 26, 1944. 

In 1944, Blondie was on the Blue Network, sponsored by Super Suds, airing Fridays at 7pm from July 21 to September 1. The final three weeks of that run overlapped with Blondie&apos;s return to CBS on Sundays at 8pm from August 13, 1944, to September 26, 1948, still sponsored by Super Suds. Beginning in mid-1945, the 30-minute program was heard Mondays at 7:30pm. Super Suds continued as the sponsor when the show moved to NBC on Wednesdays at 8pm from October 6, 1948, to June 29, 1949. 

The cache is a small pill fob that contains log only, so BYOP.

Terrain is not difficult and should be accessible to handicapped persons.
Cache is a micro containing log only so BYOP.  It rests in a heavy traffic area so difficulty will be in avoiding being muggled.

Cache ID: GC1E4EF
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: Cache is in a small cemetary south of the town of Maunie.  Cemetary is nicely maintained and is surrounded by farm land.
Maunie is a small town with only a post office these days.  It holds a special place in my heart as I grew up near here.  There used to be a small pool hall/video arcade when I was a teenager.  I was taught the game of pool (billiards) by a group of elderly gentlemen.  They have all passed on and the business has closed but memories remain of many afternoons spent playing pool with those old &quot;sharks&quot;.

The area around the cemetary is known to flood when the river is high but should be accessible most of the year. Please use caution and do not drive through water on the roads.  Cache should always remain high and dry.

Cache is small match container covered in camo duct tape so it blends into it&apos;s environment.

This is one of several caches we have placed in cemetaries in White County.  Be sure to visit them all when in the area.

DESC: Nice quite little place.  CITO.  Watch out for muggles.  Container is a labeled pill bottle that contains log only.
The Shadow is a collection of serialized dramas, originally on 1930s radio and then in a wide variety of media, that follow the exploits of fictional vigilante The Shadow.[2] One of the most famous pulp heroes of the 20th century, The Shadow has been featured in comic books, comic strips, television, video games, and at least seven motion pictures. The radio drama is well-remembered for those episodes voiced by Orson Welles.

Created by David Chrisman, William Sweets, and Harry Engman Charlot for Street and Smith Publications, and subsequently expanded on by others including Walter Gibson, The Shadow debuted on July 31, 1930, as the mysterious narrator of the Street &amp; Smith radio program Detective Story Hour.[3] After gaining popularity among the show&apos;s listeners, the narrator became the star of The Shadow Magazine on April 1, 1931;  a pulp series primarily written by Gibson.

As the years passed, the character evolved. On September 26, 1937, The Shadow radio drama officially premiered and imbued the character with &quot;the power to cloud men&apos;s minds&quot; ? the ability to become completely invisible ? a trait associated with the character for years after the show ended. Even after decades, the unmistakable introduction from The Shadow radio program, intoned by announcer Frank Readick Jr., has earned a place in the American idiom: &quot;Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!&quot; These words were accompanied by a haunting theme song, Le Rouet d&apos;Omphale, composed by Saint-Saëns.

This is the first in my School House series of caches,  I would like to see a cache  of some sort at ever School Location in the area, If any one would like to help, maybe we could form a group to place these caches , there are over 100 in Crawford Co. alone.  Just E-mail me.

Any way this one is the original Barlow School location.  A new one was built later south east of here.  This a public road up to and just past the cache, the road going on north is a privet land, yes there is a house back there and folks live there.

DESC: The Coordinates will take you to where the old care takers building that sat out next to the road, I am told that they even held school classes here for a year or two, before they built the ?North Union School? house north east of here , way back when.
There used to be a cache in this cemetery, but was removed  because of vandalism, I for one feel that the more folks like us in the cemeteries the less likely there will be vandals.  This is a larger country cemetery with  nothing special about it, except for Lincoln?s, you will find west of the center road in the south side.  It has it?s revolution Solder, and one form most every other war the US has been mixed up in.  And one day ME, but not too soon I pray.  The care taker and his mowing crew (family) know where it is.  You must go 115 yards due south to the cache. 
P.S. Please leave the rock inside, or the wind will blow the cache away.

DESC: Park on the west side of the street, please.
This cache has a rather large container to hold travel bugs and plunder. There is a combination lock on the door of the cache to help deter vandals .  The lock is similar to my old &quot;Nine to Six&quot; cache but you don&apos;t have to chant a mantra to discover the combination on this one.  Just look for the house number -either on the mail box or on the front of the house.  Use this number as the first three digits and then use 6 again as the fourth digit. PLEASE be sure to close and lock the door after you have made your trade and signed the log.  Pictures taken in front of the tree face can be posted on the cache page

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4864. (1 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip:

Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

Dropped 3 coins in this cache to be moved all over the world...

2008-12-06 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene on our last trip to the Robinson, Lawrenceville area for awhile on a seasonably cold day with a few snow flurries, some overcast skies and some brief glimpses of sun – perfect geocaching weather! The road leading north to this cache was nothing but goopy oozy slippery mud, so we decided to leave the car on high ground halfway there and hoof it the rest of the way. We looked in the likely locations to the north and were about to declare this one a DNF, but the GPS arrow dragged us away from the original spots, so we continued the search. Mean Gene found the cache lying on the ground, so we put it in the obvious location for the next cacher to find. TNLNSL.

I kept wondering, &quot;Is there a road there?!?!&quot; When I was parallel with the cache I finally noticed it. Hmmm....not much of a road, but I bet Duke can handle it.

As muddy as it was, I wasn&apos;t slipping to much, however I realized there was no real place to turn around once I reached the cache. So, I parked about 300 feet away and walked the rest.

Quick find! I signed the log and headed back to my now muddy Durango. Thankfully a very wet road crossing a little later would clean all the mud off. [:)]

I&apos;ve stopped by here a couple other times, but never had any luck. Since the cache was recently replaced we thought we&apos;d have a better chance at it.

It took a while to get to this one. We came across a sick deer wandering along the side of the road and called it it. We waited with the deer for a while, but when he finally wandered into the woods we took off for the cache.

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4938.  (75 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

Alton had a volunteer fire department as early as 1833 and built it&apos;s first firehouse in 1888 at the corner of Broadway and Market Street.
 Throughout the years, Alton had as many as 5 firehouses in operation around the city but in recent years built 2 new larger facilities and closed the old houses. This cache is located at the old number 5 station. The fire department is gone now but the building remains unchanged.

NOTE: This cache is located in front of a business. Workers will be present during weekdays. All workers are geocachers, so don&apos;t worry about being seen.

Horseshoe Lake   

Welcome to the northern shores of Horseshoe Lake. A 2,400 acre oxbow lake ,  remnant of a large meander of the Mississippi River, it is today a shallow, isolated patch of water located near Granite City and the western part of Illinois. Horseshoe Lake is situated in a low flood plain. This flood plain follows the Mississippi River down to the Kentucky border. Before the present system of levies was constructed, heavy spring floods would cause the river to overflow its banks. It would sometimes change directions and cut a new channel through these bottomlands. During this process an old river section was cut off from the flowing channel forming a natural oxbow lake. Horseshoe Lake was formed in this manner.
All lakes, whether man-made or natural, begin to fill in with sentiment as soon as they are formed. Particles of soil called silt are carried in the wind and in water runoff from nearby fields and ditches. Generally, older lakes fill in to become more shallow than new lakes. Horseshoe Lake is a very old lake as illustrated by its three-foot depth. Up and down the length of the River you can find features like this one, that the mighty Mississippi has carved on its way to the Gulf of Mexico.



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

An oxbow lake is a U-shaped lake water body formed when a wide meander from the mainstem of a river is cut off to create a lake. This landform is called an oxbow lake for the distinctive curved shape that results from this process. In Australia, an oxbow lake is called a billabong. By itself, the word oxbow can also mean a U-shaped bend in a river or stream, whether or not it is cut off from the mainstream.

A meander in general is a bend in a sinuous watercourse, also known as an oxbow loop, or simply an oxbow. A stream of any volume may assume a meandering course, alternatively eroding sediments from the outside of a bend and depositing them on the inside. The result is a snaking pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its down-valley axis. When a meander gets cut off from the main stream, an oxbow lake is formed. Over time meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges.



To get credit for this cache you must do complete the following with in 7 days of logging your find..
1. Take a photo of yourself along with your GPS at the posted coordinates with the Lake in the background.

2. Email me with this information: What is your estimate of the width of the lake and the height of the nearside bank at this location and did you detect any evidence of sandbars present? Do not post this in your logs.
Thanks

Although I had heard of Horseshoe Lake, I had never been here before and if it weren&apos;t for this EarthCache placement, no doubt I would have never seen this unique lake.  Thanks for bringing me here and for explaining how it was formed.

2009-10-10 Kurt Franke, Found it, 10 of 11 today, cache 2286.

In the Saint Louis area so my mother could attend a wedding. I came along to drive, see my brother, bike and geocaching. Spent alot of time geocaching and specifically in the pursuit of Earthcaches and virtuals. What a great way to see a new place.

The sun was going down by the time I got to Horseshoe Lake. My ambitious plan had me going on to Cahokia Mounds as well. Going to have to save that for later. Just came from Lewis and Clark State Memorial Park and the Confluence MS/MO in IL as they were closing the visitor center. Can&apos;t P&amp;G an Earthcache normally. This was a good one to end with today. No staff hurrying me along, just the State Park, the lake and the view.

I had abit of a hard time finding the entrance to the Park. For one thing, I didn&apos;t know it was a State Park. I looked at bushwacking in from 162.  The brush was abit too thick and besides, I thought I saw a road back there. (This would have been the ultimate &quot;oh that trail&quot; experience.)  Eventually found the entrance/access, drove into the park. Made my way to GZ and it was uninhabitted. Seemed like every pull off/parking spot had a fisherman there. They were all bundled up in the cold today. 

Finally took the time to read the cache page, grabbed some readings and a looked around abit, snapped a couple photos. Tiime to head home. Got to meet my brother and mother for supper some 30 miles away. Good end to a gread day of geocaching adventures.

TFTE,

park in the Little Prairie Nature Trail Parking Lot. The trail is 3/4 mile long. The Cache will be somewhere along the way. Slightly off the path to keep it hidden. Container is plastic and contains log book, pencil, and mardi gras beads.

NOTE: Original cache was compromised by the local wildlife and the bite marks were making things soggy! So I replaced the cache with a new one, same size, covered in camo tape to help it stay hidden. New log book was placed and I transfered all the goodies to the new cache.

Also I placed a bottle of hand sanitizer in there as a gift for the first to find the second time around! Enjoy!

2009-09-28 beladi1, Great day to be out hiking.  There were some muggles playing baseball in the park, but away from the cache.  Nice quick hike in the woods.  There was a geotrail right to the cache.  I first stopped at this possible hiding spot which was all trampled around.  Then I read the clue and follow me gps to about 6ft.  The cache was in the open so after I signed the log I put it back in its hiding place. 

As I was leaving I wanted to take a picture of the swamp as I was getting ready to take the picture there was a loud splash in the water.  I thought it might be a beaver.  Then the animal surfaced.  It was a deer.  I must have frightened it when I was caching.  It ran across the swamp, but when it jumped in the water was over its head.  It went under the water and reappeared on the other side.  I took a picture, but I don&apos;t think I got a picture of the deer.  TFTC.  [:)]

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4914. (51 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

This cache is to locate Mound School which discontinued in about 1947.  The school was located about 3/8 mile east just as you start up the hill on the north side. This hill is an Indian Mound which has dirt hauled from at least 1 mile away, smaller mounds are located to the south.  Quentin Abraham taught in this school and I believe he was the last teacher.

DESC: This cache started as a large ammo can won as a door prize at the 2007 Moonshine Event.  The cache was started with a log book, plenty of writing utensils, Jeep stickers, dog toys, our signature nickels, and plenty of toys for kids.  There was also a prize for the FTF in the log book.
The original cache was muggled after Labor Day 2008.  The new container is smaller than an ammo can.  Thanks to Peanutsdad for replacing the container and log.
Do not attempt to drive back to this cache.  Parking is abundant and the walk will be short and enjoyable.

Sometimes, caches seem random and hurriedly placed. Sometimes all caches seem to look the same.  Hopefully, this is not one of those caches.  It was placed with lots of thought and a few tears, too.  
Here&apos;s a little background:
My grandparents were raised in rural Clark and Crawford counties.  They were both baptized and attended the nearby church.  After my grandfather died in 1991, my grandmother moved &quot;into town&quot; and lived independently until 2002, when she then moved to the Chicago suburbs to live with my parents.  
My grandmother was a spirited woman who enjoyed telling stories and &quot;yanking the chains&quot; of others.  Last year, as she was falling into the long goodbye of Alzheimer&apos;s, we were sitting on my mother&apos;s deck, and she called my mother by name, something she had not done in a long time.  Sensing my grandmother was having a good day, I asked her if she knew my name.  She looked at me, smiled, and said, &quot;Jehosophat?&quot;  Since my name is &quot;Shelli,&quot; I laughed, never really knowing if she was kidding or not.  I would like to assume she was.
After spending only 1 month in the nursing home during the summer of 2008, my grandmother peacefully left this world. As her 5 year old great-granddaughter put it, she is probably screaming with excitement about seeing her husband again.
So, this cache is a dedication to my grandparents and their love for all of the small things in life.  We will keep it stocked up with plenty of toys for people of all ages.

Cache ID: GC1G6GQ

SIZE: Other
D1.0/T1.0
DESC: This is an EarthCache. There are ten seasonal wetland pools located within the conservation area, and the eight interpretive sites along the trail serve as teaching tools to let visitors know how rivers effect the land that it flows through.
This coordinates will take you into the Columbia Bottom Conservation Area. To reach that area go north approximately 2.5 miles from I-270 Riverview Drive exit.  Riverview Drive becomes Columbia Bottom Road at it?s junction with Larimore Road.

There is a paved road through the conservation area, and it is wheelchair accessible. 
 
The Missouri River: 
 
The Missouri is the world?s 15th longest river and, in name, officially begins at the confluence of the Jefferson and Madison rivers. The headwaters actually begin in the Rocky Mountains of southwestern Montana. It is the longest headwater stream, and thus the Missouri?s hydrologic source. The Gallatin River joins the river about 0.6 miles downstream as it flows northeast. 

In length, the Missouri drains about one-sixth of the North American continent, 9,350 square miles, before it flows into the mighty Mississippi north of St. Louis, Missouri.  The Missouri River basin includes river bottoms and flood plains, making it an ideal habitat for conservation efforts. There have been numerous attempts at preserving the natural habitats of the Missouri River Valley, for the Missouri basin lies across a major migration route, the Central Flyway, and in the river?s lower reaches, the Mississippi Flyway. 
 
The Missouri is one of the most changed rivers in the United States. Its many man-made dams and reservoirs have created many lakes and stopped the free-flowing nature of the river, stopping flooding in many areas. In July 1993, the Missouri River crossed flood plains, such as the St. Charles bottomland and the waters cut new channels.  Historically, the river has changed its course slightly many times in just the 200 years that the Americans have been living nearby.  In some places, the river has relocated more than 2,000 feet of soil. This is one reason that the Missouri is called the ?Big Muddy? and the ?Muddy Mo.? 
 
From: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia,
and socialstudiesfor kids.com 
 
The Columbia Bottom Conservation Area: 

?The Conservation Department purchased this 4,318-acre area in 1997 to create an urban conservation area. The area includes a view of the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, more than 65 miles of river frontage, about 800 acres of bottomland forest and a 110-acre island.? 

?A flood protection levee protects most of this bottom from minor floods. The great flood of 1993 overtopped this levee and flooded most of the area, depositing sand and debris.  The area will continue to be prone to occasional flooding.? 

?The Conservation Department is managing Columbia Bottom to create a mosaic of bottomland habitats that includes shallow wetlands, bottomland hardwoods, prairie and cropland. These habitats attract a wide variety of resident and migratory wildlife for the enjoyment of all of our state?s residents and visitors.? 

- Missouri Department of Conservation, 2007 

There are ten seasonal wetland pools located within the conservation area, and the eight interpretive sites along the trail serve as teaching tools to educate the visitors. Visitors will learn how rivers effect the land that it flows thru. The flood of 1993 reconnected the Missouri with much of its floodplain habitats. Since then, coordinated efforts have been undertaken to link areas of floodplain with the Missouri River providing fish and wildlife habitat and water storage during floods.

DESC: This is an EarthCache.  The coordinates will take you to the starting point where a color coded marker directs you to a wheelchair accessible trail.
In 1982, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization designated Cahokia Mounds a U.S. World Heritage Site for its significance in the prehistory of North America.  This State Historic Site was named a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1965.
  
?Managed by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site, in Collinsville, Illinois, it is located on the Mississippi River floodplain, across from St. Louis, Missouri.  This site was first inhabited by Indians of the Late Woodland culture about AD 700.  The site grew during the following Mississippian period, after AD 900, and by AD 1050-1150, the Cahokia site was the regional center for the Mississippian culture with many satellite communities, villages and farmsteads around it.  After AD 1200, the population began to decline and the site was abandoned by AD 1400.  In the early 1600s, the Cahokia Indians (of the Illinois confederacy) came to the area and it is from them that the site derives its name.  
  
However, it is the building accomplishments and cultural developments of the earlier Indians that make this site significant.  They constructed more than 120 earthen mounds over an area of six square miles, although only 80 survive today.  These industrious people moved over an estimated 55 million cubic feet of earth in woven baskets to create this network of mounds and community plazas.  Monks Mound, for example, covers 14 acres, rises 100 feet, and was topped by a massive 5,000 square-foot building another 50 feet high.  As the largest prehistoric earthen construction in the Americas, Monks Mound is a testament to the sophisticated engineering skills of these people.  Additionally, they built several ?Woodhenges,? large post-circle monuments that appear to have been used as calendars, and they also constructed several defensive palisades nearly two-miles long around the central ceremonial precinct.?

GEOLOGY: 
 
It is hard to imagine that the Mississippi Valley was first covered by a sea over 500 million years ago when hard-shelled marine organisms first evolved.  Many transgressions and regressions of the sea occurred depositing a variety of sedimentary rocks, most of which are now buried.  Scientists estimate during the early Mississippian Period, about 350 million years ago, this area was once again covered by a shallow sea.  Ancient organisms such as crinoids, corals, brachiopods, trilobites and bryozoans are now fossilized in the many layers of limestone.  During the time of the Ice Age the northern portions of North America were periodically covered by glaciers.  The Ice Age began 1.65 million years ago and ended approximately 10,000 years ago.  The ice sheets reached 13,000 feet in thickness, causing the global sea level to drop about 300 feet below it?s current level because so much water was in the form of ice.  Glaciers flowed southward from Hudson Bay between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains and extended as far south as southern Illinois.  As glaciers moved slowly over thousands of years, the huge amounts of ice changed the landscape, leveling and filling valleys, revealing the flat prairies that we see today.  The great breadth of the floodplain is due to the large volume of glacial melt water that flowed through this river valley in the waning stages of the Ice Age.  
 
It was this floodplain and access to the Mississippi River through it?s tributaries that gave the prehistoric Indians of the Late Woodland culture, about AD 700, and the Mississippian period that followed, after AD 900, the necessary resources to sustain life and develop a culture with many satellite communities.  At its peak Cahokia had a population between 10-20,000 people.  It is estimated that there were as many as 50,000 people living on farmlands, villages and small towns, in the American Bottoms which runs from Alton, Illinois to Dupo, Illinois.  Highly structured communities arose with a complex ranked social and political system.  Without this fertile floodplain they would not have been able to grow their primary crops of corn, squash and several oily and starchy seed bearing plants (sunflower, marshelder, lambs quarter, may grass, knotweed, little barley).  The tributaries gave them access to the mighty Mississippi and they developed an extensive trade network with distant areas of the country. 
 
     - I used the internet to access sources by using google search to obtain information for this EarthCache.  I also visited the site at Cahokia Mounds and gained a wealth of information from their Historic Site Interpreter.  
  
              The Treasure you Find is in the
                    Lessons you Learn. 
 
                    Leave No Trace !!! 
 
Many thanks to Mark E. Esarey, Ph.D., Cahokia&apos;s Site Manager, for granting approval, and to Marilyn Harvey, Cahokia?s Historic Site Interpreter, for supplying information and share in the excitement of having an EarthCache at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site.

2009-12-11 raleightakara, Thanks green river guy.  I enjoyed this earth cache very much.  I have lived in the area for many years and have been to the Mounds many times, but doing the earth cache made me dig deeper, and learn more than I ever have here.

2009-11-27 prairieview_IL, Caching today with my dad after going to the Indian Market.  A great alternative thing to do on Black Friday!  He has been bringing us to the mounds since were little kids and he would teach us everything he knew about archaeology and geology (which was a lot).  When we were little there wasn&apos;t much here except the mounds, many of them were tree and brush covered, we would run up and down them until we were tired (which I think was probably the point as far as my parents were concerned).  It has been great to see it grow, have the great museum built, become a World Heritage site, and have so many improvements over the years and get the recognition it deserves.

Photo of me and my dad posted, answers on the way.  TFTC!

2009-10-11 Kurt Franke, Found it, last of 7 today, cache 2294.

In planning my trip to Saint Louis, I knew I wanted to see the area with a variety of virtual caches and Earthcaches. Spent yesterday on my own, caching. Saw some cool places and learnd a thing or two about the local geology and history. The Lewis and Clark sites along with the rivers were all very impressive. 

The task today was to ride some bike with my brother, cross the Chain of Lakes and visit the Cahokia Mounds. The day was everything I hoped for and more, time with my brother, some great riding and a World Heritage Site. OMG!

Can&apos;t say enough about this place. Simply one of the most important and impresive places I have ever visited. Period.

 <desc>Confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers  by Cvivor
Cache ID: GC1G6GK
Earthcache
SIZE: Other
D1.0/T1.0
DESC: This is an EarthCache.  The coordinates takes you to the Missouri side of the confluence.  Stop and read ALL of the information around the first waypoint.
To access this area, go north approximately 2.5 miles from the I-270 Riverview Drive exit.  Riverview Drive becomes Columbia Bottom Road at it?s junction with Larimore Road.  Follow this road and it will take you to the entrance of the Columbia Bottom Conservation Area.

Follow the paved road, it will lead you to a parking lot that is located next to the Interpretive Site.  Take a few minutes to read about this location, then proceed along the boardwalk to the Observation Platform, which is wheelchair accessible.  At that point you will enjoy a panoramic view of where these two mighty rivers merge.

Two Rivers -- The Missouri and Mississippi:  

These two rivers share many similarities;  both have a lot of silt in them that is supported by the swirling currents, both constantly change or modify their crooked paths and sand and gravel bars appear and disappear, and although this makes it dangerous for navigation both rivers are navigable and they serve the entire Midwest with a water route for shipping large quantities of raw materials and products.

	- The Missouri Department of Natural Resources, 6/2002, Geology Survey and Resource Assessment Division fact sheet number 21, describes the geologic and earth science value of these two mighty rivers better than I can.  Portions of that fact sheet are quoted, as follows:

?Of the geology and geography of the two river systems, endless theories have been set forth and a continuous scientific discussion threads its way through modern literature.  Unusual geologic features are common place on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers.  Oxbow lakes, which are large, crescent-shaped bodies of water that were left in low-lying areas when the river changed course across meander loops, decorate the flat flood plains along either side of both rivers.  There are also scenic spots where the rivers left tall pinnacles of rock standing like towers.  Castle Rock, on the Mississippi is an example of this unique occurrence.  Tavern Rock, on the Missouri, is a typical bluff.  It is often noted in the history and folklore of the rivers and was visited by Lewis and Clark.?

?The flood plains of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers cover hundreds of square miles in this state and provide citizens with rich, tillable acreage for producing Missouri?s excellent agricultural products.  A second feature of the flood plains is the tremendous amount of good quality groundwater which can be drawn from shallow wells in the alluvial deposits along the rivers.  The river water seeps deep into the gravel and sediment beds and is pumped for use after this very efficient filtering process removes most of the river?s impurities.  Some of these shallow wells produce as much as 2,000 gallons of water per minute.?

?High loess bluffs (yellowish gray loam;  silt), deep limestone gorges, ?lost? hills and cut-off meanders, and millions of tons of sand and gravel, which are deposited along the almost shoreless banks, entice the scientist to a more thorough study of the origin and development of these majestic waterways.?

Earth Caching is --- 
for those who love the Out-of-Doors, and
want to learn something about the geology/earth science of
this planet that we live on.

The Treasure You Find is in the Lessons you Learn.
Leave No Trace !!!

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4919. (56 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

I had to make this one quick. There was a tractor grading the road and he was slowly making his way towards me. I needed to get this one found, signed and replaced before he got here!

The GPS had me bouncing back and forth on this one. Finally I used my eyes. Duh....there it was!

Signed the log and replaced it before the tractor could get here. Thanks!

DESC: 
This cache is to remember Pingtown School which is now the 1st house west on the north side of the road.  It ceased being a school in 1947.  I attended here 2 years.  While researching other Jasper County Schools I discovered there was a town plotted out 1/2 mile west of here on the south side of the road containing 60 lots with 3 east west streets and 6 north south streets called Pleasant Hill, IL. This land was later owned by my great grandfather and is still owned by a descendant of his.
Hint: none needed.

Finally! I&apos;ve been trying for this one for sometime now! On my first attempt the coordinates were impossibly wrong and yet fit the hint. I didn&apos;t even bother to get out of the Durango that day. The second attempt was 
when I logged my DNF. I was in the right area but didn&apos;t look hard enough. Today I came back...with a little more info from the owner.

It took a couple minutes but I finally spotted it. My coordinates put me about 20 feet to the west of the actual cache, but that&apos;s pretty much the way GPS&apos;s work. Wow! There were a ton of thorns. I had to go around a different way to finally reach the cache. Then, after signing in, it rolled out of its hiding spot and I had to go back around again. 

Glad to get this one done! Nice little puzzle! Thanks!

Cache ID: GC1G6FW
Earthcache
SIZE: Other
D1.0/T1.0
DESC: This is an EarthCache.  The confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers is located at the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site on Route 3 in Hartford, Illinois.
The posted coordinates is the first of three coordinates and it will take you to the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site Interpretive Center on Route 3 in Hartford, Illinois. All three points of interest are wheelchair accessible. 

The Confluence:

Confluence, in geography, is described as a flowing together of two or more streams, the point where such streams meet. It usually refers to the point where a tributary joins a more major river, called the mainstream, when that major river is also the largest stream in the drainage basin. The Mississippi and Missouri rivers when combined become the two longest rivers in North America, and they form the fourth longest river in the world. The mainstream of these two rivers is located at Lincoln and St. Charles counties in Missouri and the city of Hartford in Madison County, Illinois. 
 
The Mississippi River: 
 
The Mississippi is an ?exterior system stream,?which is a geological term used to describe waters whose flow eventually reach the ocean. The headwaters of the Mississippi begin at Lake Itasca, a small glacial lake in Minnesota, and flows 2,320 miles to its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico. From its headwaters to its discharge at the mouth of the Mississippi the elevation change is 1,475 feet. At the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers the volume of water in the Mississippi nearly doubles, accounting for approximately 45% of the flow at St. Louis in normal times and as much as 70% of the flow during some droughts. The Mississippi drains 1,245,000 square miles, or 41%, of North America. The volume of discharge in the Gulf of Mexico is 651,000 cubic feet per second. 
 
The Missouri River: 
 
The Missouri is also an ?exterior system stream? that flows into the Atlantic Ocean, via the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. It begins at the confluence of the Madison, Jefferson, and Gallatin rivers in Montana, and flows through its valley south and east into the Mississippi north of St. Louis, Missouri. At its source the elevation is 4,045 feet and at its mouth the elevation drops to 404 feet. The Missouri is the second largest tributary by volume of the Mississippi, trailing the Ohio River. At approximately 2,540 miles in length, the Missouri drains about one-sixth of the North American continent before it empties into the Mississippi. In its natural state the Missouri was the longest interior river in North America but channeling has cut off a significant number of miles making it comparable to the Mississippi in length. 
 
The Geological Society of America Plaque: 
 
At 38 48.112 N and 090 06.184 W, which is the second of three coordinates, you will find a marker that was placed in the ground by the Geological Society of America as part of the Lewis and Clark bicentennial events that commemorated the Corps of Discovery?s point of departure and their accomplishments.  The top half of this plaque contains an enlarged replica of Thomas Jefferson?s minted presidential coins, which he gave to Lewis and Clark to hand out as a symbol of friendship to those they met along their journey. Peace and Friendship is inscribed on this plaque and it depicts a soldier shaking hands with an Indian.  The Survey Crews still use this plaque as a fixed point when conducting their surveys. 
 
The History: 
  
It was at Camp River Dubois, which was located near the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, that Lewis and Clark spent the winter of 1803-1804. In the spring of 1804 they started their expedition up the Missouri River. The first posted coordinates will take you to what is now designated as the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site. Their gallery contains a full-size keel boat, and a replica of Camp River Dubois was constructed just outside the Center. This state-of-the-art interpretive center has a wealth of information concerning the Lewis and Clark expedition. In the early 19th century people depended on the rivers for trade, travel and communication. 
 
At 38 48.303 N and 090 06.777 W, which is the last of the three coordinates, you will be able to view the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers from Illinois. It is at this coordinates that you will need to have a picture of yourself taken with your GPSr, please stand next to the plaque that commemorates the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 
 
                  Earth Caching is --- 
          for those who love the Out-of-Doors, 
         and want to learn something about the

2009-12-19 L Frank, Denmother and I visited Fort Clatsop in August of this year where Lewis and Clark ended their Westward journey.  Today we visited Fort Dubois where the journey began.  We had a great time at both.  E-mail has been sent.  Thanks, Cvivor, for bringing us here.

2009-10-10 Kurt Franke, Found it, 9 of 11 today, cache 2285.

Big day of caching for me. In the Saint Louis area so my mother could attend a wedding. I used the time to visit virtual and Earthcaches. My favorite way to see a new area. I had a great time. The only problem I had all day, I ran out of time and sunlight. This was the first of the last. I arrived a the world class Visitors Center just as they were counting the reciepts and closing the doors. (I was lucky enough to score a couple of wooden nickels though!) In fact, I accompanied a couple of the volunteers out to their cars. 

I also grabbed some of the information I needed, had just enough time to buzz out to the landing for a photo. After snapping a couple quick pictures I headed back outside the gates and just in time, too. As I was heading out the park staff was arriving to lock it up for the night.

While I did really enjoy this spot, I did not get  to spend enought time here on this visit. Next time around I will bring the boys and we can really give it the time it deserves. Thanks for turning me on to this place.

TFTE,

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4935.  (72 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

Bear hunting made this ol Bear a little nervous... The one on the right looked like Grandpa...

Gilligan&apos;s Island is an American TV sitcom originally produced by United Artists Television. It aired for three seasons on the CBS network, from September 26, 1964 to September 4, 1967. It was sponsored by Philip Morris &amp; Company and Procter &amp; Gamble. The show followed the comic adventures of seven castaways as they attempted to survive and ultimately escape from a previously uninhabited island where they were shipwrecked.

Gilligan&apos;s Island ran for a total of 98 episodes. The first season (comprising 36 episodes) was filmed in black-and-white (later colorized in syndication) and the remaining 62 episodes throughout the next two seasons and three TV movie sequels were filmed in color.

Enjoying solid ratings during its original run, the show grew enormously in popularity during decades of syndication. Today, the title character of Gilligan is widely recognized as a comedic American popular culture icon, ranked, for example, at 122nd place in the July 2003 list of 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons compiled by VH-1 and People magazine.

DESC: M&amp;M fob - contains log &amp; pen
The Smurfs (Les Schtroumpfs) are a fictional group of small sky blue creatures who live in Smurf Village somewhere in the woods. The Belgian cartoonist Peyo introduced Smurfs to the world in a series of comic strips, making their first appearance in the Belgian comics magazine Le Journal de Spirou on October 23, 1958. The English-speaking world perhaps knows them best through the popular 1980s animated television series from Hanna-Barbera Productions, The Smurfs.
The storylines tend to be simple tales of bold adventure. The cast has a simple structure as well: almost all the characters look essentially alike ? mostly male, very short (just &quot;three apples tall&quot;), with blue skin, white trousers with a hole for their short tails, white hat in the style of a Phrygian cap, and sometimes some additional accessory that identifies a personality (For instance, Handy Smurf wears overalls instead of the standard trousers, a brimmed hat, and a pencil above his ear). Smurfs can walk and run, but often move by skipping on both feet. They love to eat Sarsaparilla (a specie of smilax) leaves, whose berries the smurfs naturally call smurfberries (the smurfberries appear only in the cartoon;  in the original comics, the Smurfs only eat the leaves from the smilax). The male Smurfs almost never appear without their hats, which leaves a mystery amongst the fans as to whether they have hair or not. The animated series canon state that they may be bald: one episode of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon has Greedy Smurf removing his chef&apos;s hat to give Papa Smurf a pie he had concealed under it, revealing a bald head. Another episode, St. Smurf and the Dragon, shows Hefty Smurf&apos;s hat rising up off his bald head briefly as he and others slide to a stop. Both Papa Smurf and Grandpa Smurf have full beards and hair visibly coming from under their hats above the earline. In The Smurfs and the Magic Flute, a Smurf took off his hat briefly for a polite gesture.

In the comics, the last page of the first album Les Schtroumpfs noirs (The Black Smurfs) shows Papa Smurf&apos;s hat blown off by an explosion, revealing his completely bald head (which may simply be due to old age). In Le Schtroumpfeur de Bijoux (The Jewel Smurfer), Jokey Smurf gets very angry and defensive when a human tells him he should take off his hat.

The Smurfs fulfill simple archetypes of everyday people: Lazy Smurf, Grouchy Smurf, Brainy Smurf, and so on. All smurfs with the exception of Papa, Baby, Nanny and Grandpa are said to be 100 years old. There were originally 98 smurfs, but this number increases as new Smurf characters appear, such as the smurflings and Nanny. Smurfette is not one of the original smurfs because she was created by the wizard. Then also in Season 1 they needed to do the dance of 100 smurfs only there was only 99 until Vanity Smurf&apos;s mirror image came to life.

The Smurfs&apos; community generally takes the form of a cooperative, sharing and kind environment based on the principle that each Smurf has something he or she is good at, and thus contributes it to Smurf society as he or she can. In return, each Smurf appears to be given their necessities of life, from housing and clothes to food. Some have argued that the foundation of Smurf society resembles the basic principles of Communism, although Peyo&apos;s son, Thierry Culliford, has stated in an interview that his father &quot;wasn&apos;t interested in politics at all&quot;.

DESC: Cache is located close to paved parking lot and should be handicapped accessible.  It is within view of local post office which, for a town this small, is very busy.  Be sure to check out small memorial next door.
We&apos;ve been looking for the perfect spot for a cache like this and finally found it.  Container is small and contains log and FTF prize.  BYOP.

Be sure to say hello to Larry if you get time to check this interesting place out.  Let him know if you found cache - he seemed interested in the game and was very willing to let us place this cache.

2009-12-12 graciedi, I noticed there was a geo-coin in this cache of ours that&apos;s been here a few months.  Since I hate to see them sit that long, dropped by to pick it up and move it along.  I had a moment of fear when I realized the tree line the cache was in has been taken out.  The tree the cache was in has been cut down to a stump but the cache was still in it.  Actually I found two.  When I placed the cache, I dropped one into the tree and it fell too far for me to retrieve so I placed another in another part of the tree.  Picked up the coin and will move it along.

2009-10-12 catdad,  OK, I made fun of the &quot;Big City Boys&quot; on a previous bridge log. Now here I am searching for  30 minutes in the dark with nothing to show for it. 
 If this was like your other similar caches you might want to check on it. If it was something different I&apos;ll be back to search again.

2009-09-06 racer2814, Visited and found this nice cache on 9-6-09. After yesterday&apos;s great event in Murphysboro I decided to head east and travel the backroads of Southern Illinois before heading into Indiana. I had a great time hunting caches in the area. Thanks for placing this cache for me to find. Orale! Live, laugh, love, cache.

My apologies for the delay in logging and the copy-paste. I got way behind and need to catch up.

2009-05-16 Gerhardus, Left the St. Louis area early this morning to cache a dense bunch of caches we kept talking about South of HWY 64!  We finally set a date and made the two hour journey.  We were not disapointed despite 14 DNF&apos;s.  Thanks for the fun day in your neck of the woods.

2009-05-16 myotis, OCW Gerhardus and Lancelot in SO IL.  Had a great day of caching.  But we had some issues with flooding preventing us from getting to caches, too many DNFs, lots of fun, and OK (windy with sprinkles) weather.  Ended up with about 50 finds for the day (and 14 DNFs ouch! Bridges drove us crazy today).  Thanks for lots of great caches and challenges.

2009-05-12 racer2814, Was headed down to Clarksville, TN for something much more important than caching but I found out he would be released from the hospital before I got there. Since I was about 20 mi. south of Effingham I decided not to waste the trip. Ran a query and decided to grab some caches heading to Cahokia Mounds. 

I left so early this morning that after a great visit to Cahokia Mounds there was plenty of day left to grab some other caches.

Easy find, Did not see a TB here. Orale! and TFTC.

DESC: This cache is located at Oak Lawn Cemetery in Edwardsville Township which is in Glen Carbon Illinois. Terrain and difficulty levels are rated as a 1.
OakLawn Cemetery was established in the mid 1800&apos;s by various family members living in the local Glen Carbon/Mont Station areas. The cemetery has some of the earliest military veterans that are buried in the area, dating back to the Indian Wars of the early 1830&apos;s. It is called Oak Lawn Cemetery, due to the fact that there are at least 15 majestic and grandiose oaks surrounding the easten part of the cemetery. 

It is a curious note that you may have to look to the Heaven&apos;s in this cemetery to discover this cache.

This should be another simple pull off and signing of the log,  Stealth may be required at times.

Congratulations &quot;killrb14&quot; for the FtF Honors.

After some searching, I found it&apos;s resting spot about 20 feet away - not sure if the wind or muggles moved it from its resting spot.  I put it back - you may want to check on it to make sure it isn&apos;t the wind moving it.  TFTH.

Cache ID: GC20MQ5
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.5/T1.5
DESC: 
The cache has been placed along the Madison County Transit Confluence Bike Trail that travels along the top of the St Louis District of the US Army Corps of Engineers levee.

 Located at Station 91 + 65, which is more commonly referred to as a floodgate. This floodgate was constructed by the State of Illinois in 1974. 

There is a Benchmark very close to the cache that indicates the US Army Corps of Engineers levee survey line.

You are searching for a magnetic container ? not a nano.

Bring your own writing instrument.

The cache is not on the floodgate.

Use common sense and some caution when searching for this cache. This is a bridge over the floodgate and there is a drop off of 30+ ft on the outside of the guardrails. For this reason the cache is not listed as kid friendly.

Parking for access to the bike trail is at the Russell Commons Park in Alton Illinois. Cache is along the bike trail approximately one mile Southeast of the parking area.

Vehicle parking at the cache is also available by going through the floodgate at the stop light on the Berm Highway (Hwy 143) to a parking area between the river and the levee.

DESC: A great little park called &quot;Patriot&apos;s Park&quot; just west of Greenville. Take the drive, into park, that is 40 yards east of Main entrance, (just before guard rail starts).. when you see the lake ..you&apos;re getting warm!!
 This little park has been visited for years by The College Students of Greenville college, for the purpose of gathering walnuts for the cooks of the school kitchen!!Now a tradition, the students make the trek, on foot, every year from the school and back....but not sure how many walnuts are collected any more!!Hee Hee  When you get close and see the lake..park there! Either walk down to the waters edge and walk the trail,guarded by tall sentries in the water, or go over land from on top, but bush wacking would be required there! Some Poison Ivy..be careful! You might see all kinds hiding places in fallen trees..good place , but not there, however, you&apos;re very warm! Be careful..not sure what lives in there! 
Initial contents of cache:

DESC: Must use these coordinates to park and start down correct trail:  N39 10.617 W89 36.838   Make like a mountain goat for just a short ways,(the upper path,even though a little narrow)!
From the parking Coordinates, pick up the path to the spot you will need to find. If you&apos;re &quot;SHARP&quot;, you might see a few &quot;POINTERS&quot;, along the trail. When you find the first fallen, &quot;Beaver tree (of many colors)&quot;, you&apos;re close. Keep going. At the next &quot;Beaver Tree&quot;(dead but not fallen), your search should,&quot;Take A Turn&quot;upwards! Not a real big cache box, but bigger than a micro, so bring a &quot;little&quot; something if you want to exchange. This is a great little spot to spend some time. When on Main road,(rt. 16) and GPS show perpendicular...pull in the dirt road and up to the top. (You&apos;ll see the lake ). This IS a Public area, so don&apos;t be afraid to drive in,( no signs of park or lake). When leaving Litchfield, If you go PAST sign saying, &quot;Hillsboro 7 Miles&quot; you&apos;ll have gone to far.        You&apos;ll have to have good eyes..container camo&apos;d. PLease replace cache box EXACTLY as found! Happy Caching!!
Hint: Once you find the Beaver tree...time to think higher,(175 degrees).

I&apos;ve looked for this a few times while it was missing.  Since we were headed to Effingham I was glad we were going to have the chance to stop and finally get the smiley here.  Last one of the day and only one searched for in the dark!

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

2009-09-05 JonesCrew, 3/5 of the JonesCrew attended the fun Moonshine event today with Flatkatz and Pika Wants Cake. We had a great trip! Cached a little on our way to Effingham (what is up with that smell there), saw a fire breathing dragon, cached on our way to Moonshine, and then cached again after the event. We hit the big milestone of 1,000 finds FINALLY! We also got a new high finds for the day of 51 caches (please note that is ONE MORE than Flatkatz---but I am sure he will break our record soon)! We visited some interesting places...most of them seemed to be cemeteries which was a tad creepy since our group caching name was Team Damned for (D.David A.Arleen M.Mariel. N.nothing E.Emily D.Dale)  as Dave pointed out in his log. 

All in all it was a great day and it ended with a great meal at Cracker Barrel in Effingham and more SLAGA members somehow found us and joined us!

One of 50 caches that I found along Hwy 50 at the age of 50 today.  Thanks for hiding this cache.

This cache really gave me a lot of trouble, but it was all my fault.  I don&apos;t know how, but I must have had my gpsr entered on the wrong spot.  I was on the south side of the highway.  I looked for quite a while, and had to climb that bank back to the car.  As I was leaving, I noticed that the cache should have been on the north side of the highway.  I had my wife/navigator turn around and I went back and rechecked my coords.  Sure enough I went right to it.  I sure was tired after climbing the bank on both sides of the highway.  Thanks for hiding this cache.

With GPSr,Walkie Talkie,InkPen &amp; Pad in hand. I marched on thru Wild animals that were jumping out the Tree&apos;s &amp; Bushes at me. 
I radioed back to the Ms. to see what the container was I was looking for &amp; before she could find the paperwork on it, I looked up &amp; thought,,Hmmmmmmmmm, What&apos;s that doing out here???
Geezzzzzzz, It was the first part. I radioed back to the Ms. &amp; Said, I found it &amp; gave the time of 3:10pm.
I then put in the coords cause I sure didn&apos;t want to walk back in the woods if I needed too.
Found 2nd part @ 3:19pm, Geezzzzzzz, I still watch out to grab things in these area&apos;s.
Took a GEOCACHING Tattoo &amp; Left 60 cents.

Cache ID: GCG6E9
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Other
D1.5/T1.5
DESC: This cache is located a couple of feet off of the Confluence Trail in Illinois and can be reached easiest while bicycling the trail.
From the cache location you can see the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and watch river barges travel thru the Chain of Rocks Canal. The Confluence Trail is a 16-mile trail that connects Alton to Granite City and includes views of the Mississippi River. This combination asphalt and oil and chip trail begins at Russell Commons Park in Alton and extends south to 20th Street in Granite City, mainly along the Mississippi River levee. The Confluence Trail also stops at popular destinations such as the Visitor?s Center at the Alton Lock and Dam and the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Hartford. The Confluence Trail also connects Illinois to Missouri over the historic Chain of Rocks Bridge.

The nearest parking for this cache is available at      N38 47.611  W090 07.148. From here you can walk or ride your bike less than ½ mile to the cache. Or you can park at the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Hartford located off of Route 3 and ride your bike about 1 ½ miles down the trail. Other parking for the trail is available at Russell Commons Park in Alton, Lock and Dam 26 Visitor&apos;s Center in Alton, Eastgate Shopping Plaza in East Alton, and on both the Illinois and Missouri sides of the Chain of Rocks Bridge. 

The small metal container has just a log to sign your name. Please bring a pen or pencil.

Since it was my choice on where to cache, Lobocs and I spent the day trying to complete one of my 2008 Caching Goals: to clear out my 10-mile radius.  At the end of the day, I only had a handful remaining.  Lobocs and I have tried to get to this one before, but could never find the parking.  I finally found it using Google Earth, and it made the cache A LOT easier!  The cache was found easily -- there weren&apos;t too many hiding possibilities there.  I wonder what&apos;s being built between the trail and the road?

2009-10-13 FireHogRider, Funny story.  I pulled off the road to hike to the cache and put on my hazard lights.  I then realized I forgot my wallet with my ID at home.  So as I was putting my stuff together (pen, GPS, cache description, etc) an ISP unit passed me up.  I looked up and then watched him stop in the next driveway and turn around.  Knowing I had no ID and would have to explain the entire geocaching thing, I put it in drive and left ASAP leaving the cache behind.  As I passed him going the opposite direction, he turned around and followed me, but turned off another direction as I turned off to head to another cache.  Phew!  Close call!  This one will have to be on another day.

We had a great visit with the property&apos;s owner and had plenty of samples.  After stowing our purchases away, we headed for the brier patch (even the dogs wouldn&apos;t accompany us).  Of course we forgot the PALM PILOT-and the clue so we came up empty.  Now we have a &apos;built-in&apos; excuse to revisit this place.
Found it
2008-08-23 G.O. John and Carol, Wow, this sets a new record for us. It&apos;s the farthest we&apos;ve found a cache from the posted coordinates! We never would have found it without help from Chris, who works at the winery. this was also #3900 for us. TFTC!

Out grabbing some caches with Nighthawk and Pneuma on our way to the Sectional volleyball game in Albion today.  I knew this one was gonna be tricky from reading the logs.  I knew it was supposed to be in plain sight, but we still looked everywhere! 

 Nighthawk borka borka-ed first so I went over to where I thought he&apos;d found it.  Still couldn&apos;t find it.  After a few min. he laughed and said I&apos;d had my hand right on it.  Ok....looked a little harder and was finally able to make the find.  The log was too wet to sign.  Very tricky and nice hide!  Thanks for the fun!  [:)]

DESC: I have placed 3 Caches somewhere in this Park with permission from the Land Manger. One of them has a First Finders Prize.(But I&apos;m Not telling Which One.) (HEE HEE!)Each one of these Caches are more than .30 miles apart.
(First Finder Prize Has Been Claimed.)
This area  was bisected by the old Cahokia Trace, commonly known as the &quot;Trace Road&quot; which ran east and west just north of  what is now U. S. 50, and was for many years the principal route from historic Vincennes, Ind. to St. Louis and the west.

      This is the third and last cache in this park, it is located on the North side of the park. ( Which is on the north side of Illinois Route 50). 
      The Cache is located along  the Cahokia Trail. The Coords. takes you to a trail marker. From there you take a compass reading of  234 degrees SSW.  And go 75 feet to the cache. ( That&apos;s using my steps which is 2-1/2 ft. strides.)

      You may park at these Coords. located by the shelter house and bathrooms across from the youth camp grounds. N 38 44.048, W 087 50.199. There&apos;s a small walk to the trail head.  The trail is easy walking and clean.

I was following some deer trails to avoid going though the thorns as much as possible when I spotted a deer hopping away, kept going forward and believe I saw him hopping off again once I got to the field. found the cache retrieved it, as I was heading off  I spot three sets of ears pointing out of the tall grass about fifty or so feet away, I stopped a moment to figure out what the heck it was and once I realizing they were more deer I pointed exasperatedly which seemed to have startled them off.    took a keychain left a keychain.

This is our first trip back here since the State bought this area and converted it into a park.  Check it out, they did a great job.

This is a dark colored normal sized container that contains several pet friendly items.  There is plenty of space to park and you will have about a 1.25 mile round trip walk on a flat easy trail.  No hills !  No bushwacking !

Boat is optional.

The GPS coordinates will get you close to the cache (20-50 feet), the encrypted clue below will tell you where it is.  The cache is well hidden in a plastic container with a purple lid.  It is about the size of a shoebox and has a green GeoCache sticker on the lid.  Please make sure that you seal the lid on the box when you are finished.  Also, please make sure you open the box away from prying eyes, avoiding poachers.  This cache has already been destroyed once, but the pictures in the camera lived on. Happy hunting!

This cache, which just contains a log, is located at the Watershed
Nature Center in Edwardsville. The center is a bit difficult to
find, so make sure you have a map. The parking lot on Tower is at
N38° 49.021&apos; W89° 58.508&apos;. 
The Nature Center is a really nice area. While finding this
cache, you can take a 1 mile flat loop trail through, forest,
prairie, wetlands, and a lake. There is plenty of wildlife and two
wildlife viewing stands. It should make a nice pleasant trip.

2009-11-07 Gubbie, I was out with my girlfriend in Watershed today.  As we were walking around, she says &quot;Is that a frisbee?&quot;  We walk closer and she says &quot;Is it really a frisbee... no wait is that a geocache?&quot;  So I went over and checked on this cache.  It looks like people have found it by accident.    Cache is in ok shape but I covered it up.  Thanks for the cache and bringing me to this park a few years ago.

DESC: Scenic area near Alton, Illinois
This area is now closed October 15 to April 15 due to visiting bald eagles.

Walk or ride your bike on a nice gravel and mulch trail to
cache. Lots of birds and wildlife in this area. Bald eagles hang out here during the winter months. 

Go to the cache coordinates above and count the number of windows in the man made structure. Be prepared to walk or bike a couple miles. Add the number of windows to the following latitude and longitude to get the final cache
coordinates. 

N 38 52.385 plus _______ = N 38 52._______ W 90 10.173
plus________ = W 90 10._______ 

Example: N 38 52.385 plus 8 windows equals N 38 52.393 W 90 10.173 plus 8 windows equals W 90 10.181.

The final cache is a plastic jar with a logbook and pen.

After finding the final cache, proceed down the road a couple hundred feet for a nice scenic view.
Hint: The cache is under some old metal plates and is approximately 8 ft. off the gravel road.

2008-09-07 jabberwock82, Nice little walk.  It was cold and foggy when I started, but by the time I was done it was sunny and hot (and I was wearing a jacket).

Turns out that I looked right at the hiding place, but didn&apos;t realize that was it until I read the clue.

I think I saw one of the grounded barges someone else mentioned.  I wondered what it was doing there.  By the way, the signs I saw said the area (or close by) was closed from Apr 15 to Aug 15.

2009-10-10 Kurt Franke, Found it, 5 of 11, cache 2281.

Had a blast, caching the Saint Louis area, virtuals and Earthcaches and a couple others for fun. I was excited to get back to Alton. Had been here years ago as my brother lived in one of the local mansions for a summer.

I quickly spied the confirmation information I needed to log the find then spent a good deal of time time checking out this beautifully maintained memorial. What a horror this must have been for so many. Nice to remeber them all these years later. What a chapter in our history. 

Part of the fun of this day was the chance to listen to my brother&apos;s radion show, &quot;Down Yonder&quot; with Keith Dudding (http://www.kdhx.org/index.php?option=com_kdhxradio&amp;task=playlist&amp;dothis=latest&amp;show=Down+Yonder&amp;Itemid=268) on KDHX 88.1 (http://kdhx.org/) . I stream the show back home, but it was a big thrill to hear in on the actual radio and see his named scroll across the dial. One more weird thing happened on my way out from this find. I got back to the main road and spotted a coffee shot, Pony Expresso on the corner. As I pulled in to the lot, I could here &quot;Down Yonder on coming from the cachemobile speakers and through my open window, fazing back and forth, strangely. Finally realized, the Pony Expresso was pumping KDHX out of speakers in front of their building. Whoo hoo! 

TFTC, the coffee and the great radio!

 <desc>Memory of the Railroad (The Game Stash) by Lucias
Cache ID: GC40A3
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.5/T3.0
DESC: This cache is placed near where a railroad used to run but has been shut down for decades.  The tracks were even removed in the early 90&apos;s and now the rocky path is used by people hiking in the area and people on ATVs.
This is a theme cache and the theme is games.  This cache is quite out of the way for most folk so I have made sure that it is worth finding.  Inside are some games I have acquired over the years and other items to play games.  There&apos;s role-playing material, a board game, a gaming magazine, dice, miniatures, a computer game, a model, a novel, and even my entire collection of a certain collectible game. There is even a miniature Orc I painted myself.  If you like games (or would like to like games) you should visit this cache.  I only ask that if you leave an item that it be game related. It could be a traditional game of some sort, a role-playing game, a computer game, a collectible card game, miniatures or a miniature game...you get the picture.  You may also place items that pertain to geocaching

The cache is about 2 foot long by a foot and a half wide.  It&apos;s about 7 inches deep and has a green top.  It is more &quot;water-resistant&quot; than waterproof so any item needs to be securely sealed in a ziploc bag.  If you look though the cache, makes sure that any bag you opened is tightly sealed when you leave.  

There&apos;s a lot of brush on either side of where the tracks used to run and there will be a little bushwacking involved.  Watch out for spiders and possibly snakes.  While the trail is flat, some places the cache may be are pretty steep.  Make sure to wedge the cache back in tightly and cover it with leaves and sticks lest it be discovered by the folks who ATV through here.

Also, make sure you take the clues below along with you in case you have trouble.  

You can park at N 39* 06.029   W 089*20.796     

Enjoy the view and happy hunting!
Hint: The cache is on the north side of the hill the trail lies upon not far from the edge where the old tressle used to be.  It is hidden in a space created by a railroad tie and some wood that have fallen against a tree.

If you have trouble, walk to the west edge of the line (where an old tressle used to be) and line yourself up with the east end of the bridge  that is to your south.  Walk 30 paces east and then turn north.  The cache is under a railroad tie right past where the slope starts.

It&apos;s starting contents are: The Forgotten Realms Atlas, Rifts Mercenaries, Crimson Skies Board Game, Mage Knight minis and rules, a painted orc (by me), my Legend of the 5 Rings Diskwars collection,  A set of polyhedron dice, An issue of Dragon Magazine that featured Dungeons and Dragons Third Edition, A Gundam Wing Kit, and Running with the Demon novel.

The littles loved the journey to the cache and back.  The cache was fairly full.  We cleaned it up as best we could by placing all the non-game swag in a large ziploc bag and dumped all of the crumbled leaves and &quot;junk&quot; out of the cache.  The container itself is in surprisingly good shape.  The cache does contain several games including a do it yourself build door bell game, sounds pretty cool. I hope many cachers come to check this one out!

2009-03-21 dholland92, My favorite cache!  I grew up 0.25 miles from here, and spent a lot of time on these track and on the tressle that used to be here.  We found it but it was VERY wet.  We took it to my dad&apos;s, dried it out, put the contents in new baggies, and added a wildlife keychain.  Took nothing except we removed a screwdriver and a pen which might have been what ripped the original baggie.  We also added a new, makeshift log book with our entry.  Read through the old one though;  it&apos;s dry now and has great comments.  Thanks for the memories!

  This is #3 and final of a series of caches that I have hidden in Harmonie State Park.  I was going to call this cache just Mix &amp; Match but when I thought of it&apos;s contents I added the Odds &amp; Ends to the name.  Cache container is a 7.62 ammo container with various articles.  Golf Ball monogrammer kit, handwarmer,rain poncho, wristwatch,bungee cords and a couple of other things.  I have also put in a prize that many people may not be able to identify.  If you can tell me what it is in you&apos;re log.  
  Park at these coords N 38&apos;04.948 / W 087 56.534. (Coords are WAAS readings).  Cache is located just a short walk down the bicycle trail and should not be a hard find. 
  While in the park also check out the Harmonie Cache and the Banks of the Wabash Cache.  Have fun looking for this cache.

2009-04-13 cardinalsfan1968, Ok, I&apos;m sure this is a very nice cache and that the park is a very pretty place to go, but think that anyone who may think of visiting this cache should know that you do have to pay to get into the park.  How much it costs depends on where you live.  We chose not to pay to geocache.  It is expensive enough of a hobby as it is.  I think any caches around the park should be placed before the pay gate.

Returned today to retrieve the TB&apos;s from the cache, especially GS1239&apos;s SOBE1. A much easier task since I could park much closer and see the trail that gets you close to the cache.

You will be on the Glen Carbon Heritage Trail to find this cache. It&apos;s a beautiful bike ride northeast from the Covered Bridge. Park in the Parking lot behind the fire station, past the ball park. Note you will cross over several roads that lead to houses so be careful of traffic,  however, most of the ride is in the forest. This bike path is popular, so try to avoid muggles. 

Or you can park in the parking lot Of Miner&apos;s Square on the corner of Glen Crossing Road and Main Street. Go east on Glen Crossing Road (down hill) and you will find the bike trail at the bottom of the hill. When you return to the parking lot, stop in Sweeties Candy Shop for a Chocolate Gelato (or bottle of water) or any of the wonderful chocolates. I don&apos;t work for them, but we love thier Chocolate Gelato and want to see them stay in business. 

P.S. Please do not remove the stamp and ink pad. Those are for letterboxing. (See letterboxing.org for details)
Hint: Look for a road crossing the trail. Near the Bike Xing sign on the left side of the trail.

I get to the site and do my thing and kept getting groups of people walking by so I decided to keep a low profile, which of course only raises everyones senses that I am up to something. I finally find a way to the cache but it was not easy. I dropped off #13 flyingmoose geocoin and was on my merry way back to the car.

2009-04-20 A Irish, I was able to find this one with a bit of searching but once found its kinda obvious.  It does desperately need a new ink pad.  The red ink has leaked out of the ink pad and inside the plastic bag.  

I was out searching for letterboxes in the area when I came upon this one.  I didn&apos;t realize it was also a geocache and didn&apos;t bring anything to trade.  I will have to have my geocache buddy, Madfaxman, find this one on his own!

2009-11-25 BlueBeadMan, I had the day off work (teaching school) and 2_cats didn&apos;t.  Hmm, it appears it is time to do some caching.  Back in August, 2_cats went caching in North County.  She found a bunch of caches thinking that I had already found them.  Whoops!  I hadn&apos;t found them--so I found a most of them today by myself.  I also found some caches in Granite City and surrounding areas that 2_cats had previously found as well.  I guess you could say that this 4300+ cache finder needed to catch up to that 1900+ cache finder!  [:P]  Well, sortof--at least our area cache hunts will be a tad bit easier to figure out.  It was a good day to do some solocaching.  This was one of the cache finds I made today.  Thanks!  [:)]  TNLNSL--Thanks again for the cache!

This is a small micro cache you will need to bring something to write with and when you replace the log place it in the lid first then close it. The cords above gets you to the parking lot and then you have to look at the bricks to find the year that Jack Watkins was born. The cords are, 
N38 49.6xx 
W090 05.737
and the year he was born is 19xx.

Cache ID: GCQEVJ
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D1.0/T2.0
DESC: Located off the MCT Glen Carbon Heritage Bike Trail

You can access this cache from either of two locations.  One parking lot is located off of Old Troy Rd. at N 38° 46.399 W 089° 56.019 and is approximately 2.5 miles from the cache.  The alternate parking lot is located off of Kuhn Station Rd. at N 38° 46.940 W 089° 52.584 and is approximately .75 miles from the cache.  We figured one trip would be good for riding a bike and the other for a nice walk.
The container is a small ammo can and is filled with Back to School goodies in honor of our oldest who just started kindergarten.  There is also a camera to snap a pic of you and your crew...we will develop the pictures and post them when the camera is full.  Feel free to exchange any items you would like.  

Most of the trail is tree lined which makes for great shade, but questionable GPS signal.  

The Madison County Bike Trail is very extensive and there are a few other caches located off other segments of the trail.

This is our first geocache hide, so please feel free to offer any comments or suggestions!
Hint: Look for the cache on the opposite side of the trail from the distance marker.

DESC: YOU CAN ACCESS THIS CACHE FROM TWO WAYS. YOU CAN PARK IN THE PUBLIC PARKING LOT OF THE RIVERS PROJECT BUILDING AND TAKE THE SIDEWALK TO THE CACHE OR YOU CAN GO PAST THE PARKING LOT AND TAKE THE NATURE TRAIL TO THE CACHE. EITHER ROUTE IS ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE. THERE IS A NICE WOODEN LOOKOUT POINT AT THE END WITH BINOCULARS FOR EVERYONE TO ENJOY THE VIEW. THIS IS A SHORT WALK FROM THE PARKING LOT WITH BENCHES ALONG THE PATH AND AT THE LOOKOUT POINT. SHOULD BE FUN FOR ALL AGES.
THIS CACHE IS ON THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS PROPERTY. THEY HAVE GIVEN PERMISSION FOR THIS CACHE AND STRONGLY ASK THAT WE STAY ON THE SIDEWALK OR TRAIL TO PRESERVE THE NATURAL HABITAT. THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF BIRDS THAT USE THIS AREA WHILE MIGRATING INCLUDING THE BALD EAGLE DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. THIS CACHE IS A CLEAR TUPPERWARE CONTAINER THAT HAS SMALL ITEMS IN IT AND ROOM FOR TRAVEL BUGS. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD SPOT FOR TRAVEL BUGS TO HANG OUT AND GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER BEFORE HEADING OFF ON THEIR MISSIONS. 

PLEASE REPLACE THE CACHE AS FAR BACK AS POSSIBLE. PEOPLE WALK BELOW THE LOOKOUT AND THE CACHE CAN BE EASILY SEEN IF NOT REPLACED FAR ENOUGH BACK.

   
&gt;&gt;&gt; 221 Travel Bugs, Geocoins, Jeeps, and one digital fish from www.geofish.net have signed the Hotel&apos;s guest registry before continuing on their missions.(Still counting)

It was an easy Find, but well worth the Trip.  To Top it off the Ranger grabbed us on the way back and let us know the Nature Reserve building was now open Weekends.  So the kids got to enjoy a great Video on Eagles, and walk away with several fun things like Cups and stickers.  the Hotel seemed kinda empty so we dropped off two travel bugs.

Wood River Massacre 
A story of the Wood River Massacre, written by Mary Enos  
    Many came from North Caroline to the wilderness of Illinois. The Moore family, William Abel and George and their relatives by marriage the Bates, Thomas and Reagan families, were some of these pioneers.
    These families and many others settled near a small river called the Wood River. They moved in, set up farms, and gave the area the name of Wood River Settlement.
    On the east fork of the Wood River stood the Wood River Block House. Families would go to the blockhouse when Indians danger was imminent.
    William Moore lived east of where the Gordon Moore Community Park is located today and the blockhouse was located east of his house.
    Across highway 140 in the northern section of the park is a tombstone enclosed by a small fence. Abel Moore and his wife lived at the site in 1814, and in 1846, at their death, they were buried there.
    In back of the Alton Mental Health Center on Fosterburg Road is a twenty foot obelisk which was placed there by decedents of the Moore family. It is just a short distance from where Reason Reagan and his wife Rachel lived. 
    The strong Fort Russell, which was located near the present day town of Edwardsville, seemed to help ward off the Indians, and had lulled the residents into a false sense of security. There had never been an Indian battle in the area.
    July 10, 1814 was a Sunday and it started out as a peaceful and pleasant day. The families in the area never expected the day would end in great tragedy.
    William Moore was on duty at Fort Butler near St. Jacob. Abel Moore had gone to Fort Russell for the day as he was on duty there. Reason Reagan and Benjamin Thomas (who was the brother of Rachel Reagan) went to a church meeting, which was probably held at the Baptist Church near Vaughn Cemetery.
    That morning Rachel Reagan and her two children went to spend the day with her sister, Mrs. William Moore. Abel Moore&apos;s wife and children were there as was Miss Hannah Bates (who was the sister of Abel Moore&apos;s wife). The day was spent peacefully while the women talked and the children played games. They were all going to Abel Moore&apos;s house for supper that night.
    In the afternoon Rachel decided to go home and pick some green beans for the meal. Some of the children wanted to go along with her. All together there were Rachel&apos;s two children, two sons of Williams Moore, and two sons of Abel Moore.
    That was a total of seven, but they almost had eight. Hannah Bates decided to go along to visit a little more with Rachel, but a short time later Hannah turned back to the Moore house. Some people thought she may have had a premonition that something terrible was going to happen. Others say her shoes did not fit well and she was most uncomfortable. Whatever the reason, she returned to the Moore&apos;s House which was closer than Rachel&apos;s. It saved her life.
    About dark, William Moore returned home and found no one there. He then went to Abel&apos;s house. There he found his wife, Rachel and the children had not yet returned.
    William and his wife decided to search for them. His wife rode a horse through the woods and William walked along the wagon path. William had gone a very short distance when he discovered a body lying on the ground. It was dark and he could not identify the body.
    Thinking the Indians were having a general uprising, he wanted to warn the other people in the area and get them to safety. He first went to Abel&apos;s house and got Abel&apos;s wife and her remaining children. They headed for William&apos;s house to get his family, having no idea if his wife had returned from her search. When they got to the house they saw her horse. William&apos;s wife came running out of the house and told her husband she thought Indians had killed them all.
    While she was in the woods she came across a human figure lying in the path. She got down from her horse and in the darkness she saw Rachel&apos;s little boy sitting beside his lifeless mother. She didn&apos;t look any further. She picked up the wounded child and hurried home. The child died the next day.
    At dawn the scene of the tragedy was found and the bodies of the children (scattered all along the path) indicated that they had tried to escape.
    The victims were taken to the burial ground which is now known as Vaughn Cemetery where they were buried in three graves, but only one headstone with the names of all those who were killed. The news of the massacre spread quickly, and the men of the area hastened to track the Indians. They, in time found out the number of Indians were small. It was not a regular war party who killed the seven helpless victims, but a group of renegade Indians bent on revenge against the white people.
    Hatred was so intense against the Indians, the territorial legislature enacted a system of bounties for the killing of hostile Indians. The government offered $50 for the killing of an Indian who entered a settlement with murderous intent.

2009-12-12 Polaris#57, Well, I came OUT of the park on a different trail than I ENTERED the park.  Filled with real interesting foundations.  Steep sections of the trail guarded with steel cable.  Perhaps there&apos;s an easy way &quot;down there&quot; but I slid down on frozen leaves.  Great area.  I bet even nicer in the spring/summer.  Thanks for the hide.

Before I gave up, I had searched every area I could think of.  I even jumped in the creek bed and searched the bank....then out on the fallen tree to the middle of the creek.  In the end, I came up with nothing but some serious chills as it wwwas cccold tttoday.

2009-05-30 orion52, F#157@1120hrs. I found this cache but not without some effort. I start by telling that I made several mistakes all of which I should have known better. I parked and left my vehicle without marking the coordinates at the vehicle, my first mistake. I didn&apos;t look at the location map close enough and took the wrong path and I decided to cut through the brush to get to the cache, second mistake. I made it but not without drawing blood and I now have very little idea which direction it is to my vehicle. Refer back to looking at map better. Third mistake, not looking at data sheet - as the coordinates of the parking area are here. After about an hour I finally exited the woods only to have to walk several blocks on city streets back to my vehicle. Again refer back to looking back at map better. Last mistake, leaving wife in car for 1.5 hours and not answering cell phone because it was on accidently placed on vibrate. She was one pissed off bitch.

2007-12-29 JustUsTwo, We almost missed this one as the waypoint was deleted on one of our gpsr’s.  Luckily one of us spotted something on the radar and the pda confirmed it.  We had a fun walk over from “Atkinson”, although we ended up bushwhacking more than we needed to.     [; )]     After finding the cache we contemplated heading over to “Deer Haven”, but our time was short.  We’ll be back.

Thanks, “Kelsey02” for the cache!     [:D]

Some of the sounds while entering the coords for stage two were a little spooky this close to Halloween.  The hike to stage two was nothing most would have trouble with.  A friend and his son were along for the adventure today, and they were still talking about this one as we headed home near dark.  Thanks for the great adventure, mystery, history, and a beautiful day!

This is a large sized cache! It contains alot of trade items and a first finders card! Take some time to look around and please use the following coords to start from.
N 39 08.872
W 087 58.397

You can drive to the cache if it is not muddy out.  If it has rained you might want to go on foot but it will be a little bit of a walk to get there.

2009-10-15 maleki, Really wanted to stop for this one as it sounded quite interesting.  With all the recent rain,  I thought the way in was a bit too much for our car today.  Maybe another time in a jeep or pickup if back in the area.  TFTC!

2009-09-05 Team Shydog, Best cache of the day. I felt a little uncomfortable driving back here, but it was worth the trip. Neat old cemetery and that big tree with the swing is just plain awesome. Thanks for showing us this spot.

2009-09-05 Tank Hounds, A great cache!! As another cacher said, the road on the GPS doesn&apos;t exsist anymore, so we took the GPS coords that were given in the cache page and headed off into the wild blue yonder. Shydog almost turned around a few times, but I kept reassuring him that that he had the super Subaru with all wheel drive and that he could make it. Even if he comes on here and tries to say that I told him to drive to the left of the lake...he was gonna go that way in the first place!! We passed the nice tree with the swing and found the cache. We took some pics at the swing. Thanks for a great cache quite a ways off the beaten path!

2009-06-28 sataraid1, Well, my GPS was showing me roads that didn&apos;t exist anymore, so I was thankful for the starting coordinates. Even so, I felt like I was just driving off into someone&apos;s private property. But I didn&apos;t see a soul and pressed on. Ended up using the 4WD, but didn&apos;t have any real problems. It was hard at times to even guess where I was supposed to be driving, but eventually I found myself back on the &quot;mystery road&quot; that my GPS insisted on.

Eventually, I found myself at the top of a hill with a *beautiful* view, and suddenly there was mowed grass and a gorgeous little cemetery! This was shaping up to be a highlight of the day.

Didn&apos;t turn out that way, though. The cache was well hidden, but the flimsy lid had been chewed up by animals, and the cache probably had a gallon of water standing in it. The container and contents, including about three &quot;replacement logs&quot; were ruined.

I was torn. It was obvious from all the replacement logs that the owner wasn&apos;t taking care of this cache. Yet it was such a beautiful spot, and anyone who makes the adventure to such a remote location deserves to find a decent cache. So .... I went back to the truck, got a pile of napkins and a fresh ammo can, and sat there in the shade and the quiet and dried off everything that could be dried. I replaced the cache with an ammo can, and left yet another new log and pens and pencils.

So, the cache is completely replaced and should be good to go indefinitely. To the next cacher, if you&apos;re inclined to make the trip back to the cemetery, do so, the scenery is spectacular.

2009-03-04 racer2814, I was going to stay home today, but the allure of 13 new caches just south of me was too strong and the weather was perfect. So I left early this morning to see what I could find. 

Was able to drive to it today. Always skipped on previous trips for some reason. Lid to container is badly broken. Orale! and TFTC.

2009-03-03 Sparayman75, Went down a very lonely road to the east of this one that was a little hairy to say the least. Then we read further and discovered the starting cords. I guess that&apos;s what me &amp; Toadpossy get for all our Lonely Road hides. Anyways we found our way to the cache and took some time to checkout the surroundings. Very interesting place. Took TB. Left New Log book, treasure coin and star trek pin. TFTC

This cache is in downtown Mt. Vernon, IN, near the courthouse.
Originally, the plan was to place the cache near Penguin Pete&apos;s
(Beffums just LOVES penguins!). But then we got there, and the
memorial outside the courthouse was so beautiful, that we knew it
deserved the cache more. (they were too close to have two there)
So, after you search for the cache, feel free to stroll across Main
Street and grab a cool treat from Penguin Pete&apos;s.

This is a micro but should be an easy find.  While here take a look at the tombstones and count them.  There are several veterans from different wars in this cemetery. Most are very old. You will find at least 3 veterans from the war of 1812, 1 from the Revolutionary War and 1 from the Blackhawk war.  Possibly more.  Hope you enjoy this cache.

      After Ghost Hunter hid his 49th cache on Friday the 13th he looked over at us and said &quot;I want to hide one more cache tonight.&quot;  He said I dont know where it will be but for some strange reason he went south heading for an unknown destination.  We traveled for what seemed like an hour when the truck suddenly came to an abrupt stop.  Ghost Hunter then jumped out of the truck and told us &quot;I feel this is the place I need to hide my 50th cache!&quot;

      We looked at each other and then we asked Ghost Hunter why here, it&apos;s just a woods in the middle of nowhere!  He replied by saying &quot;I do not know but for some reason I feel drawn to this place.&quot;

      As we headed toward the woods we all seen strange lights coming from deep within!  Ghost Hunter then ran toward the strange lights dropping his gear as he went.  We yelled for him to please stop but he kept going and eventually we lost sight of him!

      We all wanted to run back to the truck but we knew we couldn&apos;t leave him there.  We rushed to the area where we last seen him! We then went in the woods even deeper untile we discovered a small cemetery hidden in the woods by the name of Bowman.

      In the far part of the cemetery we caught movement out of the corner of our eyes and went toward it.  When we got there we saw a sight that we never want to see again for the rest of our lives!  It was Ghost Hunter but this time there was something different about him.  His eyes were illuminating with green light and he mumbled something about October 31st, and ran off into the darkness!

      If we had only paid attention to the signs we might have been able to stop him!  It all makes sense now that we look back on it. He had just hid his 49th cache as it was getting late on Friday the 13th.  The full moon was over head when he went in to the woods to hide his 50th cache and the midnight hour was upon us!

Ghost Hunter has been possessed!!

SEE RIVER LEVEL INFO HERE 
RIVER MUST BE BELOW 24 FT TO SAFELY ACCOMPLISH THIS, But expect
to take about 10 lbs of mud back to your car if recently, within a
week, of above 24 feet.
Report from Randolph County Journal (March 25) Daily River
Levels fo past week (Looked in newspaper archives, for day I was
last there)
DeLorme Atlas Annoyance page 59 is what brings most people here
huh? Yeah it bothers me too everytime I want to explore the
backroads around and beyond Perryville. Illinois atlas has the
exact same thing around Chester map as well. Anyway just my
thoughts on that.

GCP21H This is Rock&apos;N&apos;Roll, I think is also on Page 59 in the
DeLorme Challenge. Please contact me I I am mistaken 
This is the entrance to Kaskaskia Island, a portion of Illinois
West of the Mississippi River. Excessive flooding cause the river
to change course, and bringing the City of Kaskaskia down with
it.
Kaskaskia was a major boom town, and had nick names like &apos;Paris
of the West&apos;, and &apos;Mother of a Thousand Cities&apos;. It had a big
furture, but now it is in the bottom of the Mississippi River.
Some say it all began with an Indian Curse. Short version goes,
that an Indian fell in love with a french farm girl, but father
disapproved, they run away to Cahokia were later found, and they
tie the indian to a log in the river. As they push him away, he
utters a curse, that &apos;The land will always be unrested, your dead
will be disturbed from thier graves, and will be cut off from the
mainland.&apos;
Just as he said, it became an island gets prone to flooding
every year (before the levee systems were installed), and the air
pressure from the caskets caused them to be surfaced, and
ultimately digging up the other graves to be relocated up on the
hill of Fort Kaskaskia
Major Site includes the 2nd Liberty Bell, actually older than
the ohe in Philly. It rang every year from the 4th of July, 1776,

TO A SUNKEN CITY
KASKASKIA 
Father Of Waters, Native God,
Forget
The yesterday of ages you were free
Nor count tomorrow&apos;s aeons you will yet
Remain untrammeled in your majesty,
When bold invaders came, with boast profane
To make you slave, you bore them languidly; 
Till, with unwonted fear for your domain,
A city here you grappled to your breast,
Plunging her towers in your torrent&apos;s lane
Where still they lie, man&apos;s weakness to attest; 
N&apos;r spar&apos;d their grav&apos;s wh&apos;se ghosts n&apos;w stalk
Th&apos;tide, bewildered who thier sleep should thus molest; 
In vain they seek the city where they died.
Her glories vanished and thier rest denied.
to a sunken city
Kaskaskia
O mississippi, monarch or the plain,
Despoiler old! We mourn your victem low.
Now stay the mighty minions of your train,
That this poor vale may no more havoc know; 
Bid not far mountains burst torrential spleen,
Nor tempests wreak thier lightning souls in woe,
For here, beneath your flood&apos;s dissembling sheen,
A city lies, her walls and spires down-hurled; 
No stone is left whereon some chisel keen
May tell her ravished fame unto the world,
And though your ruthless fury her defiled,
Now o&apos;er her miry tomb your waves are pearled
With sunbeams, all fair to be reviled,
(bottom line forgotten)
to a sunken city
Kaskaskia
god&apos;s temple floor these level waters pave,
And by these hills his alters are defined; 
The azure-ceilinged heaven domes the nave,
While far below, to a wat&apos;ry crypt assigned,
The mother of a thousand cities lies,
In nature&apos;s vast cathedral deep enshrined,
But never on that barren floor our eyes
May find inscription o&apos;er her sodden cell:
How she rose a star in western skies; 
How on her hope there brike a dreadful knell; 
Aghast with fear, from doom she could not stir:
She paled her glory clutching as she fell,
Despoiled forever! Yet the soul of her
Went not into the sunken sepulcher
Final Thoughts
I am glad to see that Randolph County is a treasure trove of
geocaches. When I first started, I was the only geocacher here, and
had to travel far to go geocaching. 
I see many now in Chester, and Sparta, and others I have wanted
to place and got denied, but I am not jealous;  these are places
that need to be seen and apreciated.
Because I believe some to be risky, go and get them as soon as
you can, before Muggles ruin it for us for good.
My best Suggestion: Piney Creek Ravine, is the most beautiful
spot in the state
Occasionally the &apos;Curse&apos; still re-lives itself and puts the area
underwater. At these times you will have to access it by boat, or
wading through knee deep water, and other times very deep and thick
mud. 
Below is a list of Geocachers that braved the &apos;Curse of
Kaskaskia, and got to it when it was flooded.

2009-12-16 *gln, Greetings, 

Since you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an &quot;Owner Maintenance&quot; log on the cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don&apos;t let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!

Here are some important things to keep in mind:


    * Make sure that that your container is watertight and that the contents are free from debris.
    * Replace the container if the current one is not holding up in its environment.
    * If any of the cache contents are wet, dry them off or replace them.
    * If winter is approaching, make sure you include a pencil in your cache since pens can freeze up.
    * Check your logbook and verify that there is enough space left for signatures.
    * If your cache will not be accessible due to seasonal weather conditions, note this on the cache page.
    * Verify any travel bugs that are listed in your cache, mark those that have been listed in there for a while and aren&apos;t in the cache as &quot;missing.&quot;

2009-11-17 *gln, Greetings,

I am once again checking all the disabled caches in the area to see if any progress has been made on repairs.

I know that schedules can be hectic and time short but I do hope that you find the time to repair this cache.
[b]
If not repaired, this one is scheduled to be archived next month on my next check of disabled caches.
[/b] 

If you plan on having this up and running by next check then you can skip over this notice. 


From the guidelines...       http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#maint      &quot;... You may temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to hunt for it until you have a chance to fix the problem.  This feature is to allow you a reasonable time,[b]  normally a few weeks , [/b] in which to arrange a visit to your cache. In the event that a cache is not being properly maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an extended period of time, we may archive or transfer the listing.&quot;  

Thanks for your understanding.

When you have made all repairs, please  remember to post an &quot;Owner Maintenance&quot; log on your cache page. This log restores the cache to its fully-functional state and allows your cache to be shown in the search results of Pocket Queries. Don&apos;t let your cache be filtered out unnecessarily in Pocket Queries by forgetting to re-set the attribute!

[red] DISABLING CACHE: [/red]


Greetings,

I hate to pop in here like this but from reading the last couple logs on this cache, it appears that this cache may be  in need of repair or at least should be checked.   Since there may  still be  a container in the  area, I can not archive it.  When you get a chance, please stop by and do a little fixing up. If you choose to remove this cache you can archive it then.

Hope things get fixed up soon.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to Geocaching in the past and I am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the near future.

If everything turns out to be fine you can enable this  at any time. 

[b]If I do not hear from you about fixing up this cache, I will assume that it is abandoned  and archive this cache  sometime in the future. 
[/b]

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D3.0/T1.0
DESC: This cache is placed just a short walk from the car. It is in a very pretty little park called Devils Prop. The cache is very easy to walk to. There is a parking lot on Strafford Lane at N38.24.862 W088.49.792. Please respect the park and practice cito. There are some steep hills inside the park but it is well worth the walk to see.
The cache is a container in a container so look close. It is only big enough for a log and pencil but is a good idea to bring your own pencil just in case. Hope you enjoy the hunt and the day at the Devils Prop. This cache is not your traditional container . Due to all the DNF logs I am adding a   small hint but this was not intended to be easy to find but fun.
Hint: Think natural it&apos;s right under your nose.

 <desc>BIRTHDAY BOOTY by Magellan Felons
Cache ID: GCPVN0
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: &quot;Birthday Booty&quot; is located in slightly sloped forest-type terrain, a very short walk from good parking.
The cache is hidden on the ground and covered with natural camouflage. It&apos;s probably going to take a sharp eye.

Cache is filled with neat odds and ends, and the &quot;traveling dollar bill&quot; from &quot;Mackeys Find&quot;. The container is a 6&quot;x6&quot; Tupperware food storage box, with a bright red lid (No, it doesn&apos;t flash) :) 

We placed this cache after dark, and found some litter on the way in, which we packed out to a nearby container - if you notice more - please CITO

Enjoy your hunt.
Hint: Hidden under a long-dead fallen tree and don&apos;t slip you might get wet

2009-06-14 L Frank, We decided to go caching northeast of St. Louis to outrun any rain that was planning to hit Missouri today. Two muggles were parked in a truck nearby, but they weren&apos;t paying us any mind. I spotted the cache container and grabbed it, and left the area just in case they looked over. Cache had about an inch of water in it. Drained it and dried it out the best we could. The log was dry. TNL Frank. Thanks, Magellan Felons, for the cache.

SIZE: Other
D4.0/T2.5
DESC: This multi-cache is in Effingham around Community Park and some outlying areas.  From the first stage to the final is just under 1 mile.  Suggest driving from stage to stage and it is recommended that you drive to the final!  Bring your own writing utensil as there is no room.

7-19-05 Fixed Coordinates for Second Stage.
The starting coordinates take you to a stone monument dedicated to a person who also has the street named after them.  Here you will find a dedication date.  Write down the date XXXX and the first X = A, the second X = B, the third X = C, and the fourth X = D.
Plug in these coordinates to get to the second stage:
(edited b/c used the wrong coordinates 7-19-05 SORRY!)
N 3B Degrees 07.5B5
W 0CC Degrees 3A.7BB

At the second stage you will find a semi-famous monument that was restored in the past five years.  There will be two dates on it in this format: (use the numbers from the first stage to make sure you have the right dates for the second stage)
June AX, ABXA
May AC, ABAD
Let the first X in the first date equal E and the second X equal F

Now, to the final!  Plug in these coordinates to find the final.  
N 3B Degrees F7.BEF
W FCC Degrees 3A.3BA

Enjoy!

Second Stage: Druen
Third Stage: One of four corners, but which one??

[b][purple]Crowesfeat30[/b][/purple] &amp; I are off to Moonshine, Il. to get some Moonburgers.

 We had a great time of course, and ended up with 38 caches. We spent most of the afternoon caching with mikeinmo, Donut Girl, and the LFranks and some other SLAGA cachers. signing logs as Team SLAGA 1 or some variations of that.

This one didn&apos;t take long at all, but we did take a few minutes at the final to find the cache. There were some older muggles walking towards the final ara when we got there, but they turned and left after they saw us get out. Thanks teamMCLM,

2009-09-04 moodygrrl, Caching my way to  Moonshine with Badlands along Route 40 we stopped to do this nice little multi. We like to pick up caches other than traditionals when we can and this fit the bill. Curious spot for stage 2, I&apos;ll have to google it. Thanks for the hide!

2009-06-14 L Frank, We decided to go caching northeast of St. Louis to outrun any rain that was planning to hit Missouri today. We went to WP1 and got the information needed. We found a couple of caches on our way to WP2, where we were accompanied by cacher Peanutsdad. This spot was worth the whole trip! The artwork has held up well through the years. The repairs can be seen, but they did a very good job. We got the info needed for the final, and we were greeted with a bonus -- a 12-pack of Michelob Ultra was hidden at the cache site. Since we don&apos;t drink, Peanutsdad took it to marinate his BBQ. Cache was covered with ants but otherwise in great shape. Thanks, team MCLM, for the cache.

2007-11-19 Greenback, The king-of-halloween is a busy cacher, I love the cemetery hides, it seems so trick-or-treat. As we approached it appeared the cache was across the street from the cemetery, but was it really? I parked off the road and then we walked back to hunt the cache. It was well concealed at a respectable distance from any graves. After logging in we walked around the cemetery a bit, there are some really old graves here. A very interesting location indeed. Thanks for placing your cache here and giving me a reason to explore.

2007-11-19 Genius Loci, My buddy Greenback came to the rescue here, putting his hands on the cache while I was still searching in the wrong location.  After signing the logsheet, we both remarked on the fascinating way this old boneyard has been split into pieces by the roadways that pass through here.  Thanks for a fun cache and an interesting location to visit. - Genius Loci (&apos;the Guardian Spirit of a Place&apos;)

This cache is actually larger than a micro but the container will not hold much.  It is a large red (not camo&apos;d) M&amp;M tube container. You will not need to go into the woods to find this one and you will not need to disturb the stones or flowers on or near the stones for this one.
While here visit my granny Perna Inyart at coords N33&apos;39.530
W087&apos;56.816.  She&apos;s not too far away from the actual cache and is probably keeping an eye over that way. IT IS NOT AT HER STONE, NOR IS IT IN THE WOODS BUT VERY NEAR! I really do not think it is poison, but there may be some close by.

It&apos;s a good thing that no one was around because we looked really silly looking around for this one.

Good Coords made this a quick search.  What a fun cache!

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

2009-09-12 Butterfly Fox, Why is it that whenever I have opportunity to do some uninhibited caching I&apos;m never wearing the right shoes? In the case of today, they were a pair of semi-rugged baby-doll style shoes in a nice black suede. (Usually it&apos;s flip-flops, but I was driving a bus). To say that some balancing skills may be required to reach this cache is like saying some breathing skills may be needed to continue living. Not for the faint of heart. That said;  This was a terrific cache! I has so much fun. Each time I crossed the first creek, some sort of critter made the cutest screeching noise and jumped into the water. Thanks!

2009-08-22 Crazy4Moose, Bicyling with &quot;muggle&quot; friends on an unusually nice day in August - had to grab some caches while out and about.  OK - the fun of this cache was trying to figure out how to cross the creek.  Made several attempts, finally got across, climbed up the steep hill, only to realize that we were 50 ft off, on the WRONG side of the creek.  Back down the steep hill, more figuring out how to cross the next creek.  The mud from the recent rains wasn&apos;t helping.  Finally had an idea and soon had the cache in hand.  TNLN SL.  TFTC.

Largest State Park - Old Coal Mines


C A U T I O N
THIS IS A GOOD OLE FASHION, OLD SCHOOL GEOCACHE!!!
Even though the topo may not
show it, this is a rugged, and strenuous landscape. Climb up and
down hills 20 feet high numerous times.
Each trip is equivilant to
acending 200 feet and decending 200 feet one way. Also there are
thorns, ticks, spiderwebs, possible snakes. A stick will help good
for clearing away brush.
But dont let it scare you, it is a beautiful and intrigueing
landscape. (Updated May 2009)
Head notes:
- Park at N38*01.070 W089*25.523 
- This one may end up moving,
or becoming a multi before long. IDNR Park Staff have been very
receptive about this so I hope this works out
good.
This can
be done in a half mile Round Trip. I suggest taking the horse trail
until the arrow is pointing at a 90* angle (shortest distance
possible) before &apos;running into the hills.&apos;


A ROCKEY CACHE
100% Legal
100% Old School
200% Satisfaction Guarantee 




Be prepared to enter the Largest
State Park in ILLINOIS!!! A total of 19,426 Acres make up this
land, what used to be Old Coal Mines, that have been turned into
lakes that are well stocked. There are deep dark lakes, crystal
clear lakes, bright blue turqoise lakes, But what makes this really
interesting all the little hills that cover the park.

It is a very strange landscape
and may make you think you are in a different world while you are
there, looking for the cache. Yes there are literally Thousands,
probably tens of thousands of these hills in this park. The park is
divided into 5 different &apos;Units&apos;. There is the Main Park, Conant
Unit, Captain Unit, Denmark Unit, and Galum Unit.
Captain, and Denmark unitis
have each had a cache before. Captain, Galum, and Denmark have
Waterfowl rest areas so please be respectful if you wander off in
those areas. During winter months and hunting season, please wait
till after 1:00pm before taking on this cache.
There are also tons of lakes
(old strip pits) that have outstanding fishing. Many of the lakes
are accessible by car, and some lakes are only accessable by hiking
to them, along many of the easay wide trails, many intersect each
other so waypoint your parking sopt
To get to the cache, I see it
easiest to walk the path until the arrow is pointing at a 90* angle
to your left, then head into the Hills. Did I mention that there
are a lot of them? Walking in them you will see various forms of
life, like deer, turkey, coyotes, and tons of trees and
weeds.
Below is a USGS Photo of the
area, I have marked the trail with yellow dots, and a red dot where
the cache is (dots may be hard to see)


You will also notice that all this has been dug up so it is all
made up of looserocks, and you will even see ramains of coal within
these rocks, a great way to see the history and Scenery of
ILLINOIS&apos;Largest State Park. 
Please read the Warnings, Cautions, and Notes...
WARNING!!!
 - DO NOT GO SWIMMING: Remember, these were old coal mine pits and
they have steep drops down to 100 or more feet deep.
CAUTIONS!
 - Watch out for snakes, ticks, spider webs, Poison Ivy, and Loose
Rocks. Keep in mind that all this has been dug and
reshifted.

Notes

 - Waypoint your parking place. If you for
some reason forget, head south and you will run into the
trail.
-
Trees are very brittle, basically weeds grown out of control... Do
not depend on holding on to anything when goin up and down hills,
they break off very easy.
-
Decrypt clue for more instruction, This can be easilly Muggled by
some hunter taking a break.


Legal Notice
- Take nothing but Pictures, Leave nothing but Footprints. Even
though this is all manmade, please still cache this area with
respect.


- Geocache is placed on Department managed property with
permission.


- Do not place the following items in the Geocache: Food
items,inappropriate,offensive, or hazardous
materials.

2009-01-10 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on a cold cloudy weekend in Southern illinois. This was our first find in Perry County. The map indicated that the entrance was somewhere other than where we found it, so we went too far west and had to backtrack, passing Blue Heron Road in the process. 

On our way out of the park we checked to see if we could have gotten out on Blue Heron Road, but there was a cable stretched across where the road used to go. 

We saw only two trucks in the park, but no people. We hiked down the soggy trail for about 1/3 of a mile, then headed NNW to the cache over the hillocks of spoil (I read the Wikipedia article on coal mining this morning). The topo map made us think we&apos;d find a zigzag countour line to take us most of the way to the cache, but we never found it. Once we got to the right location, spotting the cache was pretty easy [; )]. TNLNSL. Thanks, rockey_f_squirrell, for placing this cache! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO.

Old Timers told of Indians using the nearby spring as well as panning for gold in the hills two miles north, long before white man built the old Wren Bridge.  Support pillars can still be seen in the Kaskaskia river near the spring.  November 5, 2004 a group of us got together and refurbished the spring.  It has been continually maintained for well over 100 years.  Passers-by used to always stop and water their horses and have a drink for themselves.  I remember carrying water from the spring some 55 years ago while camping on the river with my parents.  I can presently pan gold 200 feet from my house near the fish farm two miles north.

 This is an &quot;offset&quot; cache. It should be a generally easy cache,
terrain isn&apos;t hard and you just need to do a little math in order
to get the coordinates:)
This cache was placed to honor Illinois NG soldiers.
There were several from this area that were deployed to Iraq and we
wanted something to remind people of the sacrifices that these
citizen soldiers make.
Go to the coordinates listed on this page and at these
coordinates, get the last two digits of the year the park was
dedicated by the G.A.R. and get the last two digits of the year
that the monument to area veterans was erected. Take the park year
digits and the monument year digits and add them together. Take
that three digit # and add 43 to the end of the # (making it a 5
digit # - DO NOT add the three digit number TO 43, it will give you
the wrong
answer).
With that 5 digit # you will ADD the first two #&apos;s to the first
229 in this cache coordinates and with the last three #&apos;s add them
to the last 229 number in this cache coordinates. (Your final
coordinates will be N38°41.___ W088° 20.___)
We just found it very fitting to start the cache from this park.
Cache is in an ammo can and the original items were: bubbles,
red/white/blue candles, 18th ABN BDE patch, IL NG T-shirt
Hint: It would be the area of bleacher seats at Wrigley Field.

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

Cached a little on our way to Effingham (what is up with that smell there), saw a fire breathing dragon, cached on our way to Moonshine, and then cached again after the event. We hit the big milestone of 1,000 finds FINALLY! We also got a new high finds for the day of 51 caches (please note that is ONE MORE than Flatkatz---but I am sure he will break our record soon)! We visited some interesting places...most of them seemed to be cemeteries which was a tad creepy since our group caching name was Team Damned for (D.David A.Arleen M.Mariel.

DESC: In an Old, Old Cemetery with easement access through some pasture land.
The cache is a large Ammo box full of useless stuff and a log book. The trick is to make your way to the location. There is one soft spot in the pasture. We were in 4WD but it was not necessary this day.
 We talked with the owners of the pasture land, who had observed our efforts to find a way to the cemetery. You may pass by their home on the way to the cache. They will be looking for you. Don&apos;t be surprised if they come out to help you locate the cache. They have a story to tell about the cemetery.

2009-08-15 Second Hand Lion, Edwards 86.  Probably one of my more memorable caches!  How often do you drive into/through a private pasture?  A lot more of this out west... but in Illinois?!?!? And... Not sure where I was headed... I had to stop and ask the owner for directions!  I love their pups!  Of course I love most all pups... probably explains why I usually travel with the two GeoPups.  30 years ago, I grew up on a farm in Oregon, but not since then have I had to get out of my vehicle to open/close a gate as I drove threw.  Reminds me of an old riddle... If three elderly men are in a pickup truck... heading into a field... how do you recognize the &apos;real&apos; cowboy?  Answer...  He&apos;s the one in the middle... Because 1) He doesn&apos;t need to drive... and 2) He doesn&apos;t have to mess with the gate!  Anyways... Thanks for placing the cache and thanks to the property owners for being so receptive!  Now I can check Edwards County and page 86 off of my All-county and DeLorme challenges!

2009-07-10 Odyssey Posse, I think this was my favorite cache of the day. [:)] It took me one trip around the &quot;block&quot; to confirm my suspicion about how to get to ground zero. The weeds were still fairly high for the last 0.10 of the short hike in to the cache.

It&apos;s a shame this doesn&apos;t get more visits. I was surprised to see so many Civil War veterans in this lonely cemetery. I even spotted one Revolutionary War grave. You don&apos;t see those all that often.

These types of caches are my favorites. A big &quot;Thanks!&quot; to Gary for adopting it and keeping it going. All is well with the cache. Thanks for the fun!

2009-09-05 mmeese, Found with MMAPgirl. 
We were on a St Louis to Olney run to cache and visit the white squirrels. We didn&apos;t get as many caches as we wanted due to the rain, but we did find the squirrels!

We didn&apos;t have a map handy to get firm directions for the different cities, so we established the area the cache should be in and started searching. We found it after only a few minutes.

The log was SOAKED  We were unable to sign.

DESC: Fred&apos;s Woods
The cache is in a popular mushroom hunting woods and Fred approved the placing of a cache therein.  The beauty of the woods in the spring time is the abundance of Blue Bells and other wild flowers.  I have placed the cache fairly deep in the woods so that you can enjoy the walk. The trail will be in logging roads for the most part. 
The container is a thermos type beverage jug, completely out of place in this bucolic setting. Should be easy to spot. Lot of GPS clutter. I triangled the coords and listed an average. The cache contains a bunch of stuff for trade as well as one of my Osage Orange Wine Bottle Stoppers. A log Book and pen.
Hint: you will have a small creek to cross

2007-12-01 RGS, OCW Sniper1, Didg Guy, and cds231, (aka G Team) spending two days caching along the Highway between Olney and Vincennes after leaving St. Louis at 4AM. This was our &quot;bonding trip&quot; in preparation for a 4 man team at MOGA 2008. We had a great time, found lots of rain, and even a few caches. We enjoyed the great variety of caches and placements and thanks to everyone who had placed the caches along our route. 

I guess we lucked out on the parking spot as it was a nice walk through the woods to the cache.

2009-09-22 orion52, F#203@1230hrsDST. This cache was a fairly easy find. I was a very easy find for numerous mosquitoes that infested the area after the recent rain. The tree that caught my attention that sat along the edge of the cemetary was the quite large pinus strobus L. (white pine). A white pine 100 years old could attain a height of 90 feet and a diameter of 30 inches. I had no way to measure its diameter but I would guess it to be twice that and therefore probably twice as old. A colony calls this tree &quot;home&quot;, a colony of honey bees that is.

DESC: Now you don?t see that everyday 





 Some people are willing to go out on a limb for an unusual mug
shot. They head up Illinois 49 to a spot 15 miles northeast of
Newton and just south of the burg of Yale (population 100, give or
take). Awaiting them is the grandmother of all mug trees. The
Fischer?s started their mug tree July 4, 2003. It now holding more
than 50 china and plastic mugs, it?s an actual oak tree ascending
some 60 feet and measuring 14 feet around. The muggy oak stands for
something wholesome and refreshing. A spontaneous gesture of
amusing goodwill designed to bring a smile to the faces of passing
strangers who are tempted, if only for a moment, to branch out of
their daily cares and drink deeply from the cup of whimsy. There is
an actual cache located on the tree. The cache is a small
container, but has room for little trading items. It also contains
its own logbook. When you visit, feel free to bring along a mug of
your own and place it on the tree. Also, the tree has a logbook of
its own, so feel free to sign it also. Make sure you find the cache
and sign that logbook also. Don?t be surprised if The Fischer?s
come and visit with you while you are here. They were really
excited about geocaching.

I named this cache after the 4-wheeler trails near by which are called the Hill-Billys because of some steep hills. Miller cemetery is where you will be heading. It is a remote cemetery that not many people know about!

The cache contains a first finders card, log book, and a few items to trade.

2009-08-02 Team GatorOKC, This was probably the coolest cache of the day for us.  We came to Charleston to attend a family reunion &amp; after the reunion we drove out to Mound cemetery to visit the graves of my husbands grandparents.  We searched for nearby caches on the iphone &amp; found this one.  Though it had not been found in almost a year, we decided to give it a try.  It was kind of sad to see the little graves almost covered by grass.  Adding to the spooky ambiance was a hoarde of HUGE black flies buzzing the area.  We ducked into GZ, found the cache, took a cool necklace &amp; left some Mickey D&apos;s bling &amp; a Gator Sig item.  Thanks for the creepy cache!!  We loved it &amp; gave it a big high-5-gator-chomp for our fav of the day!!

This cache might provide a challenge to most people. When you get to the area of the cache do not try to cross the bridge with a vehicle. The bridge is always washing out and being fixed so it is hard to tell what condition it will be in when you get there. Regardless of side you come in on it can be easily be crossed on foot. Half the fun is driving to this cache the other part you will soon see! This cache contains a first finder card and log book. There was not much room for anything else. Just signing the log book on this one should be an honor in itself! 

Special equipment and training will probably be necessary to retrieve the cache. Do not attempt this cache without both.

Please be careful and the cache must be placed back where it was found to count.

2009-07-12 daggy, A four/four and a half.  NOT they way we did it.  Now that&apos;s not to say we had any difficulty getting to the cache and logging it.  Deermark had already been there and the cache was right where it was suppose to be.  The problem came when we got in the car to leave.  It seems Deermark had parked a bit too close to the side of the road.  While we were retrieving the cache the tires on the passenger side of the car had sank into mud.  The two of us worked for about an hour try to get the car out.  We tried everything.  We rocked it back and forth.  We dug out around the tires with human shovels (our hands).  We tried wedging rocks under the tires.  I hiked back up the hill to the &quot;dump&quot; and pulled out some concrete sheet roofing and boards to wedge under the wheels.  In the beginning, we were careful not to get too muddy.  In the end, it didn&apos;t really matter.  We just needed to get the heck out. We worked and we worked but to no avail.  There was no way we were going to get out of this mess on our own.  Oh, did I mention that we didn&apos;t have cell service.  Well, after about an hour, we gave us.  Deermark was going to clean up and hike out to the near farm.  Heaven knows how far that was going to be.  Deermark seemed to remember someone saying on his recent Wyoming trip that SOS on your phone means that you can get to 911 without having service.  Our phones showed SOS.  Before calling, I powered up the laptop and the Nuvi to find out where the heck we were.  Both units agreed that we had turned off at the intersection of 1600 Ave. N and 2100 St. E.  Plus, as you know, we had longitude and latitude.  Surely that would be enough for someone to find us.  Bingo, we got 911 and they were able to contact a wrecker service.  Bet this is going to cost a fortune.  So we passed the time ... Mark took a few pictures ... I looked at some caches for a future trip ... Carson, our snow white Malitise, slept as if nothing was going on ... and we waited and we waited ... then we waited some more.  One hour passed. Finally, we heard a motor in the far off distance.  Could it be the wrecker?  Nope, it was a man and his granddaughter on a ATV.  They stopped to check on us.  His response to the fact that were were stuck in the mud was, Yep, that happens sometimes.&quot;  Told him we had called a wrecker but only had emergency cell service.  He wished us good luck and moved on.  So, we waited ... and we waited and we waited some more.  Again, we heard sounds off in the distance.  It had the same type of sound but this time it was stronger.  Ahh, that&apos;s why.  Here came five ATV&apos;s.  Teenager boys with a couple of girls in tow.  They kindly stopped to inquire.  But, when we told them we had called a wrecker, they said no need, we can pull you out.  They were off their rides in the snap of a finger and had a rope hooked up to the strongest ATV in seconds.  Tuggings, pulling and mud slinging didn&apos;t move our car from its sunken state.  Not a problem to these young fellows.  They were up for the challenge.  One of them headed home for the &quot;mud&quot; truck.  Okay, if it works, I don&apos;t care is it is muddy or not.  Ten minutes later here he came in a huge FORD pick-up with oversized tires and a grin on his face.  I truly believe they were having fun with our prediciment.  Next thing we knew the car was hooked up, the tires were connecting to solid ground and everyone, including me, was hooting with success.  Deermark offered they guys some much deserved cash but they refused.  Their answer was, &quot;We pull people out all the time and sometimes we are the ones who get pulled out.  No need to give us anything.  We we are happy to help.&quot;  Three hours later, we wander down the road with both us and the car covered in mud.  Carson still sleeping in the back still pristine and snow white.  Did we give up and go home, you wonder?  Nope, we are snagging more caches but you can bet we check for mudholes as we approach each destination.

2009-05-31 HD-Dude, Well a little blood, but that wasn&apos; t from the cache, exactly.I was walking along the top when I met up with the one thing in nature that I truly hate,the dreaded snake.I was looking at the ground watching for things that slither along and when I looked up a snake was hanging in a small tree staring straight at me.Me and snakes really never did see eye to eye for very long and as I jumped backwards to escape the 10 foot python(well it may as well have been, but in reality it was more like a 3 foot corn snake.)I scraped my elbow across a tree but much better than being that close to the dreaded snake.I eventually gained my composure and slayed the basilisk then went on to climb down the cliff to sign the log.I also left one of my cars as a testimony that I had conqurred this cache.Thanks for the adventure.Love the area, hate the snakes.Oh by the way my gamin nuvi 265T brought me right to the cache.One of my better investments.

DESC: 
This bridge used to be a floating bridge. The wooden bridge after that has now been replaced with a concrete floor and can now be crossed easily.  If it has been raining you can only come in from one side. I will let you figure out which side that is!  If it is dry it can be accessed from both sides.  It is a small plastic container that contains a log book, first finders card, and a few small items to trade.

Update: The first cache was taken from this area. I have put a new cache out in the same area but not the exact spot the other one was located. This one is a pill bottle but is a little larger then your average RX bottle. I was going to rename this cache since its in a different location but did not want to lose the previous logs on here. The log book at the cache is a new one so any one who wants to come back and find this one can resign it.

Hopefully this one will stay a little longer! It only contains a log sheet so bring your own pencil. There&apos;s a little room for very small items.

This cache is located in Harmon Cemetery.  This cemetery is remote and most people do not know it is there. I have permission to place this cache. The cemetery is on private land. If you are approached by anyone tell them you are a GeoCacher. Here are the coords that you must park at 
N 39 02.516 W 087 56.788

There will be a road that turns into a grass lane at the above parking coordinates. Do not drive back the lane. Please park on gravel road and walk back. Follow the lane around and do not cross the field to reach the cache location. You will have to walk the edge of the field at one point but only for a short distance.  Its a little extra walking but the land owner does not want anyone driving back. Please be respectful of the area and do not try to find this cache while deer hunting season is in.  

The cache is not hidden very well because no one goes back there and I thought after the walk we should at least make it an easy find. There is a lot of poison ivy in the area so be carefull!

Take some time to look at the tombstones in the woods and remember the Civil War soldiers who are burried there.

The cache conatins a logbook, first finders card, and some items to trade.

I got most of the way without to much more than your usual weeds, the land owner had even mowed a single strip around the edge of the un-tilled field, coincidence maybe, but it worked out well. 
Got to the last 20 feet or so and appeared to be solid poison ivy. After the long trek to get back there, wasn&apos;t stopping there. Took all the precautions when I got home, we&apos;ll see...Really neat spot, wish I could have looked around more.

If you know how to read road signs then you probably will not even need to use your GPS on this one. There&apos;s nothing really special about the area. I was just driving around and liked this place so I thought it would be a good place to put a cache. It is a pretty drive with woods on all sides and it is even better at night! I placed this cache at night with the moon almost full. If you go at night it is a great place to listen to the owls.  This is an easy one and the cache is only about 5 to 10 feet from the road.

The cache contains a log book and a first finders card. There was not much room for anything else.
Hint: Walk between the two road signs straight to the edge of the woods

Despite the name, you CANNOT reach this cache from the Interstate.  Cache is a small black magnetic &quot;key box&quot; type container.  Bring your own pen or pencil as there is only enough room for a logbook.  However, there is a small award for the FTF.  You might have to &quot;get down&quot; to find this one.  Have fun.

Wow, what a creepy old house.  It was right out of Wizard of Oz, and I was expecting to see the ruby slippers and striped stockings sticking out from underneath.  Found the cache after a  bit of looking and searching old logs.

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

The Old Red Bridge is 170 feet long, 14 feet wide and 13 feet 6 inches tall.  W.T. Washer built the Old Red Bridge in 1875.  This single span Smith #4 truss bridge, and crosses the Big Bayou Creek.  The Old Bred Bridge may be one of the harder bridges to find some say.  This bridge is located off County Road 1675 West, just west of Owensville, and just one-half miles east of Goose Pond, Gibson County.

2009-11-01 divicwall, First cache in Indiana!!! Truth be told I was caching in eastern IL with Advnturskr4 and had never gotten one in IN so I jumped across the border and snagged this on about an hour before I lost the light... it was a bit off the beaten path but it was worth the drive when I found the bridge... very very neat... second one I have found near a bridge...

Brewster&apos;s Millions Memorable Quotes:

Monty Brewster: Gentlemen, do you think I&apos;m a lowlife? 
Tailor: Oh no, Mr. Brewster. Not with these clothes. 

And another:

Monty Brewster: Why is it when there&apos;s trouble we&apos;re the ones that get into it. I mean, there&apos;s a bar full of people and we&apos;re the only ones in jail. 
Spike Nolan: I don&apos;t think it&apos;s racial you know, because I&apos;m in here with you. 
Monty Brewster: That&apos;s comforting.

I sure thought that was trash and not cache!

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

Cache ID: GCWMDF

SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T1.0
DESC: An easy cache with a nice piece of history available. But it will
take some time and you need to pay attention to the DETAILS.
These coordinates will take you to the village of Kaskaskia,
Illinois. Kaskaskia is located on the WEST side of the Mississippi
River. But wait isn?t the Mississippi River the border between
Illinois and Missouri? Check on your history of this region around
the end of the 19th century. There was a ?high water? event that
changed the shape of things. Kaskaskia was the first capital of the
territory of Illinois and has a unique history. France sent two
bells to America. One is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and
the other is located here in Kaskaskia. It is interesting that both
bells have developed cracks. I have been told that this church
structure is only the third rebuilding of the church. The bricks
used here are from the second building. 
Link 1
Link

Link 3
Link 4
Link 5
The above links provide some information on the history of
Kaskaskia and additional information on the ?Curse?.
The church is open on Saturday afternoons for a weekly mass. If
someone knows if it is open any other time please let me know.
To log this cache you will have to go to the village of
Kaskaskia and read the four plaques or signs. You might want to
bring a calculator.
N AB CD.EFG
W HJ KL.MNP
A = The year that Clark occupied the town divided by 592.
Discard the decimal portion of the answer.
B = A + 4
C = The last digit in the year the Liberty Bell of the West
Plaque was erected.
D = The second digit in the date referred to by the ?National
Society Colonial Dames XVII Century?.
E = The number of men that Lewis and Clark arrived with minus
twenty-two.
F = The year that Clark captured Kaskaskia divided by four
hundred forty four, discard the decimal portion of this answer.
G = The numerical equivalent of the one hundred and sixteenth
letter on the Lewis and Clark sign.
H = Use the same plaque used for F. What is the numerical
equivalent of the 12th letter on that plaque?
J = Add the two dates listed for the arrival of Clark and his
troops near Kaskaskia.
K = A freebie it is the same as C.
L = Add together the first and the last digits of the date and
year that Lewis and Clark arrived in Kaskaskia. Then add one to
that answer.
M = The numerical equivalent of the twenty-eighth letter on the
?Lewis and Clark in Kaskaskia? sign.
N = The approximate number of troops that Clark raised minus
170.
P = What day (date) was the ?Liberty Bell of the West? rung in
celebration.
A suggestion was made that check sums would be helpful. OK
North coord = 26 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; West coord = 43
While you are here go to the building housing the Bell of the
West. It is the closest building to Illinois street. There are two
buttons next to the door on the right hand side. Forget about what
Mom always said about pressing buttons and press the big one and
then after something has happened press the smaller one.
If you are traveling from the Illinois side of the river try
stopping by GCW3X0 and then once across the river you?ll
find that fuel is much less expensive.
Enjoy!Additional Waypoints
Hint: Go slow and enjoy the location. Watch out for turtles on the road.

We all figured we had not been out here for 35 years.  It looked a lot different then, but that was at least 2 major Mississippi floods ago.  We enjoyed what was a review of a history lesson for us.

I loved the history of the area.  A couple of the clues were a little odd.  So we tried it a couple of ways and it was easy to figure out which was correct.  The final was a quick find for Kid Dylan.  These can be tricky sometimes.  Thanks for the awesome cache and the highlight of the day.

2008-10-19 otisb89, This was the main cache I wanted to find today, but, alas, I came up empty. Like most of the others, I would appreciate it if the directions for figuring out some of the numbers in the coordinates were a little more clear. I&apos;m pretty sure I had the right coordinates, but I couldn&apos;t find a cache anywhere. It&apos;s a neat idea in a neat place, but it can be both tedious and confusing, which I&apos;m sure turns some people away from this one. Also, I notice it hasn&apos;t been checked on since May. Is it even still there? There was a lot of flooding in Illinois back in June.

2008-10-12 jvechinski, Found on day 11 of my Milwaukee to New Orleans (and back) motorcycle trip. What an awesome cache!  The whole history / legend / curse of Kaskaskia was so intriguing, and this turned out to be one of my favorite caches of the trip (only 300 miles from home… go figure).  It was foggy when I drove to this one and I was surprised to have the big church appear out of the fog seemingly in the middle of nowhere.  It took me some time to collect all the necessary numbers (yes I agree with some previous cachers that this is probably a little more complicated than necessary), and I checked and double checked them (since they didn’t seem right)… but the coordinates were dead on, as my GPS was reading 1 foot when I spotted the final cache container.  Thanks for placing this cache!

Cached a little on our way to Effingham (what is up with that smell there), saw a fire breathing dragon, cached on our way to Moonshine, and then cached again after the event. We hit the big milestone of 1,000 finds FINALLY! We also got a new high finds for the day of 51 caches (please note that is ONE MORE than Flatkatz---but I am sure he will break our record soon)! We visited some interesting places...most of them seemed to be cemeteries which was a tad creepy since our group caching name was Team Damned for (D.David A.Arleen M.Mariel.

DESC: With all the hype for the upcoming movie I just had to place this
cache. 
The good news is that you don&apos;t have to fly to the far reaches of
the NORTH pole to find this one. 
You also don&apos;t have to use the giant gold KEY to open the lock.

Just for fun why don&apos;t you list your favorite comic hero in your
logs.

2009-09-05 JonesCrew, 3/5 of the JonesCrew attended the fun Moonshine event today with Flatkatz and Pika Wants Cake. We had a great trip! Cached a little on our way to Effingham (what is up with that smell there), saw a fire breathing dragon, cached on our way to Moonshine, and then cached again after the event. We hit the big milestone of 1,000 finds FINALLY! We also got a new high finds for the day of 51 caches (please note that is ONE MORE than Flatkatz---but I am sure he will break our record soon)! We visited some interesting places...most of them seemed to be cemeteries which was a tad creepy since our group caching name was Team Damned for (D.David A.Arleen M.Mariel. N.nothing E.Emily D.Dale)  as Dave pointed out in his log. 

All in all it was a great day and it ended with a great meal at Cracker Barrel in Effingham and more SLAGA members somehow found us and joined us!   


By the way---we think we know what eyes might have been on us, but the eyes were all elsewhere today.

2009-09-05 Pika Wants Cake, JonesCrew (Dale, Arlene, and Emily) Flatkatz and I attended the very popular Moonshine Event today.  We cached along the way over here, saw some critters, reached milestones...JonesCrew got 1000th find out here, and our final tally of caches for the day? 50!  We had an absolute blast out here and enjoyed all the caches! [:D]  We signed the logs as either: Slaga Slackers, Team DDam, Team Damd, or Team Damned.  The name progressed as we cached more and more cemeteries.  TNLNSL  TFTC!!!!

D.David A.Arleen M.Mariel. N.nothing E.Emily D.Dale. We just could not resist the Team Damned especially considering how many cemetery caches we started doing. It was especially enjoyable when we started having vultures and dead things around. It really gave our name that much more significance.

2009-08-25 Brawny Bear, 4924. (61 of 140) Caching during the Geoblitz II run with Mike_Anderson1492, Gerhardus and Happykraut. We drove from good ol St. Louis to Olney arriving close to 8:00 AM. After we had planned our M.O., we loaded the truck and set course for 100+ Geocaches. We had a lot more on the list but we really knew we would be humping it to make it past 150. It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip: Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

You are looking for a sponge bob tin.

Good luck

Ok when it rains huey road floods so if it has been raining you might want to pass on this one

Also the people at the house that is near the cache not only know about the cache but also like to watch people get the cache.  They are my parents so don&apos;t worry. 

Also the dogs are loud but harmless.

Temporarily Disable Listing
2009-12-15 ILReviewer, Based on the previous logs, I&apos;m temporarily disabling this cache. When the owner checks in, if it is replaced, they can re-enable the cache by posting an &apos;enable&apos; log to the cache page. If the cache owner does not contact me by posting a note on this page by December 28, I&apos;ll assume the cache needs to be archived.

Welcome to Home Tweet Home - a quick little cache in Effingham County.  It&apos;s a good place to visit with some feathered friends.

Cache is located on private property.  Landowner has given permission for DAYTIME caching.

Do not park on the main roadway.  It&apos;s safer to park on the grassy field road on the south side of the woods near the sign that says &quot;Welcome to our nest.&quot;  Just a short walk from there!

2008-08-30 RGS, After a great time at MS II it was time to hit some caches. I teamed up with cds231 and Didg Guy and we logged as 3 Amigos. We had a great time and found some great hides as we headed south. Thanks to everyone who placed all the caches in this area.

Yep, it was nice to find this after a couple of DNF logs from other STL cachers. Sure didn&apos;t expect it as it sure fit in the area.

RGS - St. Louis
Found it
2008-08-30 cds231, After the event over in Moonshine Didg Guy, RGS and myself gathered forces and went south and east. We really had a good time,located some very good hides and ended up back in Effingham for supper. All logs were signed as the &quot;3 amigos&quot; to save space in the logbook.

We almost did not stop to do this one since we saw some DNF recently. Instead of driving on by we thought we would give it a try. Didg Guy had it in less than a minute. Great hide and this was a new one for me. So..... now I know what to look for if I ever make it to South Texas.

Thanks for the hide,

I have had this idea for awhile now and just found a good place to do it!  I have not seen this done around here so I thought I would give it a try.  You might not like this cache if you have a fear of snakes, spiders, and damp places! When I went to hide this cache I encountered all of the above!!  

Please do not try this cache after it has rained hard because you might not be able to get to it.

Your looking for a micro cache with a log book only so please bring your own pen!

2009-11-07 L Frank, We knew this was going to be a nice caching day, so we decided to grab a few close to home, head south, and see how far we get. The last time we tried to get this cache, the field was full of corn and we decided not to cross the field. Made it back down here today, and they had just picked the beans, so it was an easy walk to a good hide. Left a geocoin and 2 TBs. Thanks, rixart, for the cache.

SIZE: Small
D4.0/T2.0
DESC: NOTE: The coordinates given above are NOT the coordinates for this cache!
Salem, IL has an incredible amount of history for a town of it&apos;s size. Some surprising historical significance is forever linked to Salem?s past. This cache is designed as a journey through the time capsule of Salem?s legacy, and it will require some extra effort to complete. We patterned this cache after the Inland Empire History Hike cache located in Southern IL on the bluffs of the Mississippi River. We wanted to create a similar cache with Salem area history, though we didn?t make it a multi-cache, and we left out the quadratic equations. Finding the final coordinates to this cache requires you to visit the library or do internet research that will educate you on some well-known and maybe not-so-well-known history about Salem and the surrounding area. After you read each short vignette, a simple question or math problem will be presented for you to solve, which will provide you with one of the missing digits in the final cache coordinates. The cache is a small plastic container, (color modified), and contains a First Finder Award (after all that work), some small trade items, a log and pencil.  

Let?s get going!!! 

The New Madrid (Missouri) quake of 1811? the quake that caused the Mississippi River to flow backwards and church bells to ring as far away as Boston ? sent Capt. Samuel
Young, along with his son Matthew, searching for a more hospitable home. Capt. Young found things more to his liking upon reaching Salem...abundant game and tranquility. He made camp on what is now the courthouse square. He decided to return to Tennessee and bring the remaining part of his family to Illinois Territory. 
In what year did Capt. Young bring the remainder of his family to Salem?
The fourth digit in this answer is equal to digit #1 in the
coordinates. 

The southern section of Illinois from an imaginary line that runs west from Vincennes, Indiana to St. Louis, Missouri is nicknamed, ?Little Egypt?. The most prevalent idea why Southern Illinois got this nickname happened after a severe winter in northern &amp; central IL, that created so many planting problems for the northern farmers, they ran out of grain to feed their livestock.  Wagon loads of farmers sought corn in southern Illinois, the only part of the state that escaped the severe winter weather. This was compared to the Biblical story of Joseph?s brothers traveling to Egypt to purchase grain, and southern Illinois became known as ?Little Egypt?, and Salem became known as, ?The Gateway to
Little Egypt?. 
In what year did the severe winter weather occur?
The second digit in this answer is equal to digit #2 in the
coordinates. 

Luther B. Easley Post #128 of the American Legion in
Salem is the home of the G.I. Bill of Rights. The idea was written on a paper table cover at the Legion Home, and it grew into legislation that passed Congress. It was drafted by Omar J. McMackin, Earl W. Merritt, both of Salem, former Gov. John Stelle of McLeansboro, Dr. Leonard W. Esper of Springfield, George H. Bauer of Effingham, William R. McCauley of Olney, James P. Ringley of Lemont, and A.L. Starshak of Chicago. The plan was taken to Washington D.C. by Gov. Stelle, who was with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt when he signed it into law. The official title is
the Servicemen?s Readjustment Act and it was created to assist veterans of active service in the Armed Forces during World War II, but it was labeled the G.I. Bill of Rights. Using the format mm/dd/yyyy, what date was the G.I. Bill of Rights signed into law by President Roosevelt? 
The second digit in this answer is equal to digit #7 in the coordinates. 

Max Crossett&apos;s X-tra Fine Salad Dressing was a salad dressing and sandwich spread at Max Crosset&apos;s Cafe in Salem, IL. Crosset sold the recipe to Kraft Foods for $300.
Kraft changed the name to Miracle Whip, and still manufactures it today. It is advertised as having the taste of mayonnaise with half the fat. Miracle Whip debuted at the Chicago World&apos;s Fair during the height of the Great Depression. Not only was it tasty, but it was inexpensive, making it very appealing to consumers. 
In what year did Kraft Foods introduce Miracle Whip at the Chicago World?s Fair? 
Add the last two digits of the answer together and this number is equal to digit #8 in the coordinates. 

The oil boom transformed the City of Salem drastically... from a small, quiet town recovering from the depression in the 1930&apos;s, to a city hit with a different kind of jolt in its economy. Only this time, the economy quickly turned upward instead of downward. Trying to meet the immediate housing, food and everyday essential needs of hundreds of people who had moved into the Salem area, seemingly
overnight, was almost paralyzing at first. When the initial shock of the boom calmed down, the Salem oil businesses were part of the second highest amount of oil production in any one area. In 1939, how many millions of barrels of oil were being pumped out of Marion Co.? 
The first digit in your answer is equal to digit #4 in the
coordinates. For how much a barrel were producers selling oil at that time? 
The first digit in your answer is equal to digit #6 in
the coordinates. 

The house still stands in Salem, in which William Jennings Bryan was born on March 19, 1860. Bryan had an active
political career during his entire life, from working as a young lawyer, to serving as Secretary of State for Woodrow Wilson, to working as a powerful prosecuting attorney. Because Bryan had deep religious convictions and cared about ordinary citizens, he became known as the ?the Great Commoner?. He was also a powerful speaker, and was often called ?the Silver-Tongued Orator?. Bryan unsuccessfully ran for President of the U.S. an unprecedented three times. In 1925, he served as the prosecuting attorney at the famous
Scopes Monkey Trial, where the issue of whether evolution should be taught in school was argued. John Scopes, the teacher accused in the trial, graduated from Salem High School in 1919, and Wm. Jennings Bryan delivered the address to Scope?s graduating class. A 32,000 lb. statue of Bryan that once stood near the Potomac River in Washington D.C., was brought to Salem and dedicated in Bryan&apos;s honor in 1961. What three years did Bryan unsuccessfully run for the Presidency? 
Add the three 4-digit numbers together. The third
digit in this answer is equal to digit #10. 
The last digit in this answer is equal to digit #3 in the coordinates. 

A few miles east of Salem, alongside U.S. 50, sits the Half-Way Tavern. Half-Way Tavern got its name because it was the halfway point between St. Louis, MO and Vincennes, IN. As a young attorney, Abraham Lincoln would ?ride the circuit? from courthouse to courthouse trying cases in his
early days, and most likely visited the Half-Way Tavern from time to time. Captain George Rogers Clark also followed this trail across Illinois in his march from Kaskaskia to Vincennes. 
What year did Captain Clark march across Illinois and through Salem? 
The second digit in the answer is equal to digit #9 in the coordinates.

Henry Lee Borden, was the bachelor son of Gail Borden of the Borden Condensed Milk Co. in Chicago. Henry married a widow and legally adopted her two sons. In 1884, Henry acquired 964 acres northwest of Tonti in Marion Co., IL where he built a 22-room mansion and 40 outbuildings on the property in 1888. Mr. Borden was a wealthy man, and he intended to make the farm the essence of gracious rural living. The home was made entirely of soft pine. Everything about the farm was spectacular. It had its own water tower and ice house.
It even had its own generating device for supplying electricity to the house and barns at a time when few farmers had the service. The Borden farm was always ?lit up like a Christmas tree and quite a splendid sight at night?. As many as 30 hired hands lived on the Borden farm;  families in tenant houses, and single men in bunkhouse quarters. Employees of the Bordens were treated as a big family and
not as servants in any way. It is said Borden had ice cut from Lake Michigan and shipped down by railroad car to Tonti station. The farm also had gardens and a deer park, and people came from miles around to view the place. Mr. Borden, who was an avid hunter, died in 1904 from a lethal case of botulism he contracted from eating a duck he had shot that had not been properly iced. Mrs. Borden and her two sons continued to spend their summers at the Tonti farm
until fire destroyed the extravagant mansion in 1920. 
In what year was the mansion built? How many rooms were in the mansion? 
Add these two answers together. The fourth digit in the answer is equal to digit #5 in the coordinates. 

You now have all the digits in the coordinates to the cache, and you have learned some interesting Salem area history. It has taken some time and effort, but we hope you enjoyed your journey through ?Gateway to Little Egypt?.


Email when you think you have the correct answers and I can  verify the coordinates for you.
 

Happy Caching!

When I asked at the visitors&apos; center, the nice lady told me that the trail had been closed on Monday as there were drilling for recently discovered oil back there. Cool for this park but disappointing to us. Maybe later.

A new cache in the Mason area for everyone to travel to!!  This cache is a medium size Lock &amp; Lock placed at a small, rural cemetery in Effingham Co.  The cache contains various trade items and a logbook.  A pencil is included with a small sharpener.  The area is clearly marked and easy to get to.  I have left out a hint but if anyone needs a little help feel free to contact me for one. 

Also, in the past there have been a number of Deer hunters in the area, so it&apos;s advisable to not seek this cache during firearm season.

I do have permission to place this cache.  However, with a residence nearby I ask that NOONE search after dark.  Also please remember to CITO the area. 

Happy Caching.

2009-06-06 Level80rogue, When a park and grab goes wrong...I was holding the log in one hand, the brightly colored container in the other, and screaming from around the corner comes 10-15 teens on ATV&apos;s. Talk about a muggle attack!! Went back to my truck, pulled out of their way and let them go by, and returned the container after they were down the road a way. I doubt they really cared about what I was doing, they were probably just glad to see that I wasn&apos;t &quot;the law&quot;. TFTC

This is another Halloween themed 80&apos;s movies cache.  You are looking for a black film canister with a grey lid. My accuracy was showing about 15 feet but it kept taking me elsewhere so I will give you a little help.  It is NOT magnetic attached to the bridge and it is not in the woods close by.  I did up the difficulty since it appears to be a more difficult one to find than the others!

Here are quotes from the movie:

Tagline: Ten Years Ago HE Changed The Face Of Halloween. Tonight HE&apos;S BACK! 

Plot Outline: Ten years after his original massacre, the invalid Michael Myers awakens and returns to Haddonfield to kill his seven-year-old niece on Halloween. Can Dr. Loomis stop him? 

Ten years ago he changed the face of Halloween. While being transferred from a mental institute, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddenfield, to kill his niece Jamie Lloyd. The power goes out all over the town, and Jamie and her step sister Rachel are locked in the house alone with Michael...

D2.5/T2.0
DESC: Located in Welborn Cemetery near Mt Vernon, IN. Cache is not near
the graves - you do not need to disturb any graves to find the
cache. Cemetery closes at dusk, please do not attempt this cache at
night (logs claiming night caching will be deleted).
Goldilocks and the Keebler Elves spent this week searching in a few
cemeteries for their perfect Elf home. After leaving Bellefontaine
cemetery, they traveled to Dunn Cemetery, to see if they would be
more comfortable. Once Goldilocks moved them from there, they
traveled over to Welborn cemetery to try to find a bit more piece
and quiet. None of the living trees at this cemetery were
hospitable, but there were the remnants of a tree that had the
perfect little hidey hole for Goldilocks and the elves.

They were enjoying the quiet comfort of the countryside, and had
settled into a slightly &quot;unique&quot; elf home. But this time,
Goldilocks suddenly realized she was very much in the middle of
nowhere - it was just TOO quiet for her! All that was nearby was
the little church next door (with parking, but obviously parking
will be filled during services). Oh, and a few cornfields.
Goldilocks just couldn&apos;t handle it for long, so she left behind a
small camoed container with a log (BYOP).

This is another installment in our &quot;Goldilocks and the Keebler
Elves&quot; series. Like the other caches, the goal of the cache is NOT
to place an impossible to find cache. They are all in or near trees
(where else would you find an elf home?). In this case, you might
need to search just a bit for the hiding spot, as the container
just kinda fades into it&apos;s hiding location.

cache logs denoting night caching will be deleted.
Goldilocks and the Keebler Elves realized that they have not had
much success in the woods, so this time they tried searching in a
few cemeteries for their perfect Elf home. After leaving
Bellefontaine cemetery, they traveled to Dunn Cemetery, to see if
they would be more comfortable. They were enjoying the quiet
comfort of the countryside, and had settled into a slightly larger
elf home. All was well, until the first night. Goldilocks suddenly
realized that she was in a fairly remote cemetery in the dark - oh
NO!! That was just a bit too spooky, so it was time to pack up and
head off again.

In this case, Goldilocks left behind a small camoed container,
large enough for a log and a few tiny trade items, but not even
long enough for a golf pencil (BYOP). This is another installment
in our &quot;Goldilocks and the Keebler Elves&quot; series. Like the other
caches, the goal of the cache is NOT to place an impossible to find
cache. They are all in or near trees (where else would you find an
elf home?). In this case, you might need to search just a bit for
the hole, as it&apos;s rather small.

Cache is located in Black&apos;s cemetery - where you will find many old
gravesites if you have the time to explore. It also is unique (at
least to us) in that the cemetery contains working petroleum pumps.
Cache is a 35 mm film canister (I know), hidden near a tree - you
do not need to disturb any graves to find this cache. Cache is
hidden fairly discretely, but well. Please do not build a large
mound of sticks over the cache. Instead please rehide as found - so
that it is hidden from muggle&apos;s eyes.

             THE EXORCISM of GHOST HUNTER

        If you payed attention back in January on Friday  the 13th and 14th Ghost Hunter became possessed by what we now believe to be an evil spirit!!  The full moon was over head that night as we went out to hide what became our 49th and 50th cache hides... (The Possession of Ghost Hunter)! 

	If you remember that horrible evening then you recall what Ghost Hunter was mumbling as he went running off into the darkness that night.  Well we now know what he was talking about!! He just recently returned home after 10 months of battling the demon that dwells within him.  During the time that he was gone he was seen many times out geocaching and hanging around the local cemeteries.  The people who did come into contact with him said he appeared to have nothing wrong with him!  

	Ghost Hunter was last seen at the local Cache Slash event where he conducted a paranormal investigation demonstration.  After he logged the event cache he walked off into the moonlight once again!  This time he left a strange note behind telling how an exorcism can be preformed to drive out this strange force within him. 

       We have been reading his note and it seems that the only way to get to the first stage of performing an exorcism on Ghost Hunter is by finding a set of coords in his note!  This is all we have to go on so please read it well and I hope there is someone out there that can help him!!!


GHOST HUNTERS NOTE BELOW!

	I must leave  because the twilight is approaching and the 31st of October is here.  Only the fearless and those that are strong at heart can help me now for I have to light 7 candles in a circle, a circle that never ends.  Friday the 13th came again in October and the full moon on the 7th.   The 31st of October 2006 you should have known if you had only payed more attention to the 31st and 13th that this day is here!  It is because these numbers are the same that an exorcism can be performed.  The 13th becomes the 31st when the numbers are flipped and the 7 candles represent the harvest moon! The Harvest moon is the full moon that occurs nearest to the Autumnal Equinox.  In one out of three years, it comes in October and 2006 is one of those years.  The next full moon will be November the 5th but it might be to late for the seven candles cannot be lit after then but the exorcism can still be performed if the candles are found!   

	Only 4 out of 6 people believe that possession is real but there were 422 cases just last year!  Like a Ouija board you either believe in it or you don?t!!  The board might be of help though if you look at the last set of numbers on it and reverse them to form a new number. You can ask the spirits on one board or even five boards for the numbers but I assure you they will lie to you every time!  

	Halloween is rumored to be the time when the veil between this world and the next is at its thinnest which allows spirits to crossover from their world into ours more freely!  There will be one going home this Halloween!! If not the portal will remain open in the north long enough for 38 spirits to cross over but they must head south at 7 or 8 before the candles are lit and Ghost Hunter is set free from the evil spirit that dwells within him!! 
 
        You might need a knowledge of Astrology, Astronomy, Physics and Quantum Mechanics, Geometry, Psychology, and an extreme knowledge about the spirits of the dead for this one!

As you embark on this journey into the unknown ask yourself the question do you believe?

Curiously, we found another cache in the same general area, although it&apos;s not listed at geocaching.com, or navicache.com, and I couldn&apos;t find it using [i]Google[/i]. I think that Ghost Hunter&apos;s exorcism was a complete success, so we can ring the bell, close the book, and extinguish the candle http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell,_Book,_and_Candle – oh wait, that&apos;s for excommunication, not exorcism. We&apos;ll just light one of those candles and say our prayers [; )]. Thanks, Ghost Hunter! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO

2007-12-01 Mean Gene, Caching with Roelsch in eastern Illinois on the first really cool day of the season.  This was an interesting adventure and provided an opportunity to see much of the area.  Our guiding principle on this one was that it is better to light just one candle than to curse the darkness.  There seems to be another cache near the final that is not related to Geocaching.com.  We signed that log too.  Took nothing and left nothing.  Good job.  Thanks, Ghost Hunter, for placing this cache.  – Mean Gene and the Rooter St. Louis MO

Cache ID: GCZMRN

SIZE: Micro
D2.0/T1.5
DESC: Cache is located at the edge of Bellefontaine Cemetery in Mt.
Vernon, IN. You do not need to go near the graves to find this
cache. Cemetery closes at dusk - logs denoting night caching will
be deleted.
Goldilocks and the Keebler Elves realized that they have not had
much success in the woods, so this time they tried searching in a
cemetery for their perfect Elf home. Unfortunately, this time, the
space they found was a little too creepy. They were in
Bellefontaine Cemetery in Mt. Vernon, IN and found a tiny little
elf home - with a wonderful view of the water! But, once they had
settled in, they noticed that their hidey hole was at the edge of a
special section of the cemetery - the infant and children&apos;s plots
were right across the road from their new home. Goldilocks was
afraid to disturb the slumbering angels, so she left a camoed
matchstick container behind with a log (BYOP), and she and the
elves went off in search of a new elf home on down the road.

This is another installment in our &quot;Goldilocks and the Keebler
Elves&quot; series. Like the other caches, the goal of the cache is NOT
to place an impossible to find cache. They are all in or near trees
(where else would you find an elf home?). In this case, you might
need to search just a bit for the hole, as it&apos;s rather small.

Memorable Quotes from 
Halloween II (1981) 

[after Michael disappears] 
Doyle Neighbor: What&apos;s going on out here? 
Sam Loomis: Call the police! Tell the sheriff I shot him! 
Doyle Neighbor: Who? 
Sam Loomis: Tell him, he&apos;s still on the loose! 
Doyle Neighbor: Is this some kind of joke? I&apos;ve been trick-or-treated to death tonight. 
Sam Loomis: [looks at the blood on his hand] You don&apos;t know what death is!

Sam Loomis: I shot him 6 times! I shot him in the heart-but... HE&apos;S NOT HUMAN!

Budd: Happy Halloween. 
Karen: Budd, you are the biggest jerk I have ever met. 
Budd: But you love me... 
Karen: Yeah, and I&apos;m an idiot.

Jimmy: God, they should have handled him more carefully. 
Laurie Strode: Who? 
Jimmy: Michael Myers.

Jimmy: Yeah, he&apos;s the guy who was after you tonight. 
Laurie Strode: You mean from the Myers House? That little kid who killed his sister? But he&apos;s in a hospital somewhere! 
Jimmy: He escaped last night. 
Laurie Strode: How do you know? 
Jimmy: It&apos;s all over the radio. Television too, it&apos;s on right now. 
Laurie Strode: [gasps] Why me? I mean, why *me*?

Cache ID: GCZK8J
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D2.0/T1.5
DESC: 
This cache is located in Jones Cemetery.  I named the cache His Last Words because of a tombstone in the cemetery.  As you pull up to the entrance you will see a grey colored tombstone with the name Jones on it.  At the bottom of the stone you will find his last words!  You dont see that very often so I decided to place a cache here.   The main problem is finding the right road to get to this one so study your road map before you go out.  When I first went to look for this cemetery a few years ago I had no luck because the road coords I had found on an old map were way off!!  If it is muddy you might not want to try this one!  Both of my GPS units were drifting a little when I took the coords so I will include a hint just in case!

This place is kinda weird at night but it is better you come during the daylight hours! There is an oil well close by that makes an eerie sound in the woods back behind the cemetery!

This is a decon container with a log book, rubber ant, and some quarters!..lol  Anyway please bring your own pen!

Took the film canister to start a micro cache someday, and left a beaded bracelet and some K-9 swag.

My pup really enjoyed the evening run in the tucked-away little hollow.  We got out of there before it got too dark.

Thanks for the cache!

Warning!
 This cache might not be at the coordinates posted when you go
looking for it!
This Cache is a Moving Cache, it&apos;s rules are a little different,
please read all of them and try to follow them.

When you find this cache take it with you, then hide it
somewhere else and post the coordinates in your log on the cache
page so we can update the coordinates.
Please, if you take the cache move it quickly, ( no more then a
day or two is reasonable ), it takes the fun out of it for others
when it&apos;s out of play for weeks or months.
Please don&apos;t go find the cache and leave it there, it&apos;s meant
to move.
Do not log a find on this cache unless you found it, moved it,
and posted the coordinates of where you left it to be found next in
a log on this cache page.
Don&apos;t make the hide too hard, the point of this cache is to let
it move around a lot, if you stick it somewhere where people will
have a hard time getting it you mess it up for everyone.
Don&apos;t make the terrain too hard, long hikes that are not done
often by geocachers are not a good idea. If the cache gets stuck
for the winter on some snowy peak or something it takes all the fun
out of it for a lot of people.
Please be careful where you hide the cache so it doesn&apos;t turn
up missing!
Please have fun!

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D1.0/T1.0
DESC: This cache is located in Buck Road Cemetary in Maryville Township of Illinois. Terrain is just off of the hard surface. Difficulty and terrain only warrant a 1 on the scales.
Buck Road Cemetery was established in 1867. It is located on Route 162, 1 mile west of IL Route 159, and 2 miles east of IL Route 157. The majority of names that you see on the stones, are of Bohemian descent &quot;which today is the Czech and Slovak Republics in Eastern Europe&quot;. The cemetary is divided into 4 blocks, and is approximately 4 acres in total. Block 1 has the gazebo, Block 2 has the Cross of Christ/W.W. 1 statue, Block 3 houses the flag poles and Block 4 houses the newest gravesites. 

This was one of our first cache hides, and we decided to request this cemetery with the approval of cemetery officials.

This is a simple pull off and sign with a small mason jar sized jar as the container. Some small trade items would be fine.

Congratulations &quot;killrb14&quot; for the FtF Honors.
Hint: Let the cross of Christ be your guide, as yew &quot;you&quot; look for a green mason jar.

The SLAGA
County Challenge

Find a cache in each of SLAGA?s 76 counties
and attend an event in SLAGA territory.

 




 
Congratulations to
CribbageWitch for being FTF!

 We have all seen the various challenges that have gone up based on
covering an entire state. That makes it difficult for those of us
who live in SLAGA territory because we live near the edge of our
home state, no matter which side of the river we live on. So, I
have setup the SLAGA County Challenge to allow cachers to get to
know our territory. It has been informally suggested that SLAGA
covers an area within 100 miles from the back yard of some
long-forgotten SLAGA charter member. In keeping with that thought
but moving it slightly, I drew a circle within 100 miles of the
benchmark located at the south leg of the St. Louis Arch. The
circle encompasses in total or in part 76 counties. In order to
complete the SLAGA County Challenge, you must find a cache in each
of the 76 counties and attend a geocaching event within SLAGA
territory. In order to insure diversity, I have included some
requirements in the list of administrative rules below.

 1. all caches must be found after you post a note stating your
intent to complete this challenge
2. all caches (except the event cache) must be a physical cache
with a log that is signed
3. The coordinates of the cache as listed on geocaching.com will be
used to determine which county it is located in
4. The cache may be anywhere in the county. For counties that
border on the 100 mile circle, the cache itself does not need to be
within the 100 mile circle.
5. at least one cache must be in a National Forest
6. at least one cache must be in a state park
7. at least one cache must be within a mile of a major river (the
Mississippi, Missouri, or Illinois River)
8. at least one cache must be on an island. See my note on Nov. 14
for more information about islands
9. The four caches used for requirements 5 thru 8 must be four
different caches
10. There are 20 counties in SLAGA territory that share the same
name. (i.e. 10 in IL and 10 in MO with the same name) You must find
a cache in one pair of these counties on the same day.
11. I like benchmarks. You may substitute a benchmark find for up
to 6 counties. It must be a disk type benchmark. A benchmark find
must be logged on geocaching.com with appropriate pictures showing
that you have found the correct benchmark as shown by the stamping
on the disk. The find must be after you posted your note stating
your intent to complete this challenge. Sorry, other types of
benchmarks, including intersection stations (i.e. towers,
buildings, etc), bolts, nails, chiseled squares, etc. that can not
be verified are not allowed.
12. If there are no caches available in a county, use rule 11. If
you are a super-cacher who has more than 6 counties without an
available cache to find, use rule 11 and send me an email so I can
verify.
13. You must create a bookmark list of your list of caches and
submit it to me to be certified. Be sure to make the bookmark list
public so I can see it. Also send me an email to indicate which
caches you are using for the National Forest, State Park, river,
island, county pair and event caches, any benchmark finds that you
have and any other extenuating circumstances that I need to be
aware of.
14. I expect that finishers will want to come to the next major
SLAGA event to be recognized. As long as the event is a logable
event and you have submitted an intend to attend log, it may be
used for the event requirement.
15. You may submit your partial list to me to make my life easier
and the final certification go faster.
16. Any found logs that are posted without proper verification will
be deleted.

 Now for the exciting stuff:
A. Once I have verified that you have completed the challenge, find
the final cache as listed in the hint.
B. SLAGA is creating a plaque to display the names of the SLAGA
County Challenge finishers.
C. SLAGA has graciously offered 25 SLAGA coins in a new finish to
be given to the first 25 finishers.
D. A rare reviewer coin will also be given to the FTF and possibly
2nd finder (Thanks to our reviewers!)

2009-12-19 TEAMR&amp;R, We started the challenge on 11/07/09 . After caching for 8 1/2 days, over 2400 miles, many out of the way places, seeing 1 eagle, numerous deer, we finally found the last cache on 12/05/09. We went to the SLAGA christmas party, but due to a family emerengy, we had to leave early.  Would have liked to meet more cachers but it just didn&apos;t happen this time.  Went to the final today. GPS was pointing to an obvious place, but after searching for awhile, we had no luck.  Started to expand the search area, and Hey, that doesn&apos;t look right. Sure enough, there it was.  Signed the log and replaced cache.  Thanks RogBarn for creating this caching challenge, it was a lot of fun.

After close to 14 hour, 600 mile, 18 county, 22 cache day on Friday in order to catch up to CribbageWitch then an early morning walk on water to the island the next morning and a run to event last night and having my truck shot craps 70 miles from home and having it towed back after the event - A 2nd to find Smilie on this particular challenge was &quot;Priceless&quot;  

Well worth doing and recommend it for anyone to do. 
I almost can&apos;t believe it!  (other than staying up late 3:30am logging and double checking everything) in order to have it verified in time to go with Cribbagewitch this morning to find the final (and yes she indeed found it first).

Thanks for a great challenge.

2009-11-26 OzarksJim, Find # 1920. This was the only cache I found during our trip to my parents house in Rock Island, IL for Thanksgiving dinner. After my wife, son and I spent a few minutes at the McDonald&apos;s down the road, I decided to go after a quick cache. I used the Geocache Navigator application on my cell phone to find the cache since I didn&apos;t have any caches pre-loaded on my Palm or GPSr (which is when Geocache Navigator comes in handy). The cache was a quick and easy find, and I signed the logbook for myself and my son, OzarksRyan, who caches with me often but stayed in the car on this cold and windy afternoon. If I had been in Troy on a business trip, this is the hotel where I would have stayed because it is my hotel of choice. Thanks for the quick cache. ~OzarksJim - Willard, Missouri

Welcome to Tri-Township Park.  This park has amazing things for the kids and family to enjoy.  Playgrounds, baseball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, and even a nice running track.   While you here grabbing caches I hope you will takea  few minutes to enjoy this beautiful park.

This cache is not located near a playground so no one should feel awkward going for this one...although stealth will be required.

Please replace the cache as you found it and please be gentle.   

Cache on!

Hello, and welcome to Abigail?s Cache!! Abby is my granddaughter and this cache was created for her, we have just started with Geo Caching on some weekends and hope you are having as much fun as we did. Cache is handicap accessible to within 4 ft of GZ.  Please observe these hours as gates are locked and it is not legal to be in the area outside of these hours.  Permission was granted thru IDNR site superintendent if you happen to run into Mic on the property please thank him for allowing this placement.  Please observe all site rules and regulations.  This cache is a Small Clear Blue Watertight box. Please seal the box back up and replace it where you found it. Be careful when opening and closing the latches on the box there a little tight and I am hoping they do not break, just push hard to close. If they do let me know. Please sign the log book for Abby. We have placed some items in the box for you Take and Leave cachers. This cache originally contained a small ball for your puppy, a rose for mom, 3 party poppers, 1 noise maker, 2 balloons, a necklace, bat ring, and scorpion. I hope the noise maker and or poppers will make your trip interesting in the car with the kids. 

Please re-hide the cache in the same manner that it was found and be discrete about finding it as there are a lot of muggles in the area. Sit back and enjoy the view until it is safe to uncover it..CLOSED Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Day

DESC: The most difficult thing about finding this cache might be just driving to it.  It is kind of off the main travelled roads.  When you get there, parking is very easy.  (Hint) Is there any sign of ticks?.  Be sure to look up.  Small black canister.   I put in my 2 cents worth.  Be sure to visit the nearby Cemetary in the woods.  At least 7 Civil War Veterans are burried there.  Parking area is gravel and flat, so it is fairly accessable.

2009-12-18 ETMH88, The Mrs and I needed to do a little shopping nearby and I remembered something about a cache.  Now being without a gps never stoped me before it has just made a dnf.   As luck would have it We met someone who knew about caching and even allowed me to use one of those new fangeled dohickies and I was out looking while Michelle did some shopping.  Now I&apos;m used to an arrow pointing the way and this dohickie didn&apos;t have an arrow just a blue dot and a green dot so I had to ask which dot I was.  Off I go again with a new lease on caching ok so it must have taken a bit as Michelle came looking to see if I was OK.  Well I finally found the cache and  signed this well placed cache.  I would like to thank the cache owner for placing the cache and for the use of the dohickie.  Nice to meet you!!!

Others tell stories of loved ones who&apos;ve died on this piece of highway.  Needless to say, be very careful.  There is ample room to pull safely over to the side of the road.  I wouldn&apos;t recommend letting the kids out of the car to try to find it, though.

DESC: I ended up on this dirt road while planting other caches in the area.  Fortunately it hadn&apos;t rained lately so the road was drivable.  I&apos;d say it will take a 4 X 4 after a good rain.
After planting this cache, I drove a little further down this road and saw some deer stands.  I would say this area is prime deer hunting territory.  You might not try it during deer season.

Cache is a small lock&apos;n&apos;lock with a log and small trade items.  FTF prize.

When I was a kid, we used to cross Possum Bridge all the time only back them it was a rickety wooden bridge that only one car could cross at a time.  I occasionally still have dreams about crossing that bridge and it falling down.  I haven&apos;t been through this area in years and today was the first time I&apos;ve crossed the new bridge.  Quite an improvement.

There is ample room to pull off the road.  Cache should be an easy find.

She too thought the bridge would fall into the water at any time. TNLNSL. TFTC.

New caches will be posted in the area closer to event time. Prizes will be handed out after you have warmed up. Might even stir up some hot chocolate or coffee.

**Be careful all. Just been warned by fellow cacher this is shotgun deer season weekend. Sorry forgot. Might consider breaking out the orange hat for safety reasons or stay out of fields and woods. Some hunters forget to count legs before they shoot.

Out for an afternoon caching run when I spotted this one coming up fast. Based on the title I had a pretty good idea what to expect and unfortunately I was right.

I searched a total of 73 spots before I found this one. I unrolled the log and discovered I was FTF. Yay. That made the the whole tedious nature of searching for this one worth while.

Then ZBQ called me. After chatting for a bit I mentioned that I had just found this cache. He commented that he found it this morning. Hmmm...how could that be? There was no other signature on the log. Wait...what if there are TWO caches here? 

Yet another oddity in caching, huh?

DESC: Buttermilk Hill Trailhead - Strange activity in this area
(Yeah this was Tornado Damaged Forest earlier, but, just like TV
shows, the original title or theme never lasts) 
This is an absolute Beautiful area, and even
once you get past the initial roadside growth, it is a very nice
and spacious forest environment.
But there had been reports
that there is something different here, that cannot be proven by
scientists yet. I am bringing this up cause I heard strange noises,
and had that funny feeling something was watching
me.
And
Now, after the FTF report, I knew I wasn&apos;t going crazy. I thought I
heard stuff as well, but with chainsaws going off as they were
clearing fallen trees from that &apos;Inland Hurricane&apos; we had, it was
hard to tell.


I heard that grunting and growling as well. I know there had been
reports of Mountain Lions in the area. I have seen them twice
before. Be careful just incase it is a Mountain Lion that is
hanging around the area.


We need more geocachers to help me see if it is
a Mountain Lion, cause, it still sounds different then a Cougar
squall. It sure has me
puzzled

GZ area is really cool. However, if going in do not do this at dusk or later! We made our way over the fallen trees and branches to the cache. Recent rain made this one even harder. Very defining odor surrounded us and a low growl came from deep in the woods. Was that J&apos;s stomach? No, he said. Threw stuff back in, stuff cache back and tore out.We literally ran back to vehicle. J and I tripped over rocks and branches getting back to car. 

We were huffing and puffing and I squealed tires and took off down the road hoping to miss the huge pot hole that we scrapped driving in. Dang, did we even sign the logbook???  #1454.

This is a small jump from Real Strange Monster Advisory
The area is Johnson Creek Recreation Area of Kinkaid Lake which
features a BIG SWIMMING AREA, the only other area other than the
spillway, but much easier access.
This lies on top of a bluff/cliff, but If you take the trail you
can probably get this with 3 star terrain. Anyone else please let
me know if you do get it by the trail and I will lower it to 3 star
terrain, but I made the steep climb when I first placed it.
You can sit and watch cars go by without them knowing you ar
there. Cache is a black PVC pipe about 18 inches long, and LOG ONTO
A ROLL OF FILM, with a SHARPIE which is provided. There is a stick
to hlp in winding the film back up o THE STICK IS NOT GEOJUNK
You DO NOT have to flip over any rocks. I did in an area about

2009-05-24 photohiker13, FTF!!  Found around 9:45 a.m. 

After an interesting search the cache Real Strange Moster Advisory, we made our way shakingly to this cache.  We noticed that it had not been logged and was looking for a FTF.  We wound our way up towards the campground area and looking for a place to park. We parked off the side of the road by the campground entrance and made our way by a dumpster and down threw an unknown forested area.  We shortly found ourselves on the edge of a rocky bluff.  We found this creative cache after a little searching.  TFTC!!

As for the name, we thought on this one awhile on the drive back and we come up with the following to somewhat link the two caches located in this area. We used the suggestion for the acronym and here it is:

Real Good Juxaposition.  (If you don&apos;t want to use this one, it will not hurt our feelings to leave it open for the next person)

We thought it was a nice way to tie the two together.  This cache calm, the other cache disturbing.

Multi-cache
SIZE: Regular
D2.0/T2.0
DESC: This is a multicache out near Governor Bond Lake.  This area was not maintained for a while, but last fall a few local youth groups and organizations got together and did a renovation on the area, cleaning up and making the trail better and able to be used.
I thought that it was time to get a multicache out in this area, and this place seemed like it would be great for it.  This is a 2 stage multi, so it will not take much longer than a typical cache.  This is a neat area, too.

I hope you enjoy my first multi!  Good luck!

Make sure that the lock is completely closed before entering the combination, or it will not work properly.  If it is giving any problems, try jiggling it a little bit.

Additional Waypoints
Hint: Stage 1: Near the brush, one might find something from Busch.

Stage 2: Right 3 times then stop on the first number. Left turn passing the number once and then stopping on it.  Right turn to number.

DESC: Located in a very busy area.  Muggles abound.  You will need to use stealth to find this one.  This cache is handicapped accessible.
Cache is very small.  Tweezers will probably be a necessity in getting log out.  

If you&apos;ve found Giant of a Cache in Carmi, you&apos;ll think you&apos;ve seen double. 

This one might be easiest to find early in the morning or late at night due to being a high traffic area.  If you look for it during the day, look next door (to Big John&apos;s right) and wave, &quot;wii&quot; might see you.

You are looking for a match case with a 1&quot; dia. x 3/16&quot; neodymium magnet taped to it.  This magnet is strong - but not excessively so.  However, I would suggest that you NOT place your GPS or other electronic device right next to it.

It was a 3 hour drive from St. Charles, MO to the first cache so we had a 3 hour drive back. Thanks to Mike_Anderson1492, we had just the right tools needed to make this a successful trip:

Multiple 5 hour energy bottles... Check!

We had an awesome time caching in the Olney, Lake Newton, Robinson and Palestine areas. There are a lot of cache left to do. Can&apos;t wait for a return trip to get more caches.
Sorry for the cut and paste logs. Where I made notes, I have indicated in my logs. I am just too old to remember everything about the day other than it was a BLAST!!!

Dropped 3 coins in this cache to be moved all over the world...

2009-12-06 2beabout, I will try for this one some day, but I know what happened to the first one.  I signed that log tonight in the middle of a gravel road next to &quot;Meridian Road NANO.&quot;  Got muggled looking for the nano by the lady that found the old container.  She had been weed eating and found it.  When she pulled up she thought we may have been looking for a deer.  We told her what we wre doing, and she reached for the dash and pulled this one out and said &quot;Then this one needs to go back to E street.&apos;&quot; or something close to that.  I signed the log and asked her to put it back.  I think she may.  She asked to see the GPS and wanted to know where to get one.  i hope she puts it back and geta her own GPS.

We had over 200 caches on our list but we wondered just how many we could do. I&quot;m thinking we stopped at almost 150+ caches and logged about 140. This shattered my old personel best of 57. Great day and great company. Brawny managed to squeak over 5000.  What a day indeed!

2009-12-06 2beabout, What an interesting event this one was today.  Arrow had done a flip and we were looking on wrong side of road.  Got muggled by a friendly lady that thought we were searching for a deer.  Talked for a while and let her in on what we were doing.  She was very interested and wanted to see the GPS and was asking several questions, then she reached into her dash and pulled out a micro she had muggled in Olney.  I signed both logs here (the nano and her traveling cache), and we told her to put the other back.  She has had it since July.  She even asked about where I purchased my GPS.  May have spread the fun today.

With frozen fingers I would have dropped it for sure but today was much warmer and I was able to hang on while signing log.  As something probably expected after a couple of local events, the log book is pretty full and could use a replacement sheet.  This was number 39 of 52 today.

2009-10-17 JanS03, Caching in the Sumner area with Lake_Wannabees after registering at the CS Fest and receiving the coords for the 15 new caches by air, flown in by a Beaver Ultralight.   Found the cache easy enough, but opening it was another thing.   Used a little pocket knife and pried it open.  Thanks PBJack!

2009-10-17 lake_wannabees, This fit a little more into our expectations than the Wagnor cache did.  We had a heck of a time getting the cache container open though.  I took a picture of the attempt and was going to submit that to the owner as proof that we did find it when JanS03 remembered that she had a small knife with her and we were able to open the container.  In honor of all that hard work, I dropped a pathtag in the container for the next muscleman or woman.

We needed our tools to get the container open!

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

Great coords made this one the highlight of the day.  We looked and looked and then read logs and still weren&apos;t having any luck.  Then saw that Mean Gene and Roelsch said coords were dead on, so we stuck to our guns and his highness made the find.  Then it still took us a minute to figure it out!

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

I was dirtracted by another hidey spot first.

After a great day at Moonshine yesterday, it was time to get out with his highness, Fuzzy B and see some of the dusty country roads.  We spent a great deal of time on conversations dealing with the color of the corn and beans, and I practiced jumping from the moving Cache Wrangler while listening to Fuz grind the gears!  We had a great day getting over a hundred caches all during the daylight, wow, now that&apos;s a first.  I also saw dozens of old abandoned farmhouses and lots of barnyard animals, including one calf who snuck out of the pasture and who I helped get back in.  What a fun day to be out with the King!

Springer&apos;s Woods has 10.4 acres, and is a wooded nature area that winds through a quiet neighborhood in the central, north end of the City. Besides its natural beauty, a children&apos;s playground, an exercise trail, and two picnic shelters are located with in the park.

This cache is located .15 miles from where I grew up and is in close proximity to the old exercise trail.  Unfortunately the city has failed with the up keepof the park over the years and this location has one of the last remaing fitness trail signs.

Traditional Cache
SIZE: Small
D1.0/T2.0
DESC: This cache is located in Horner Park. The cache is hidden along the Trillium Trail. So enjoy the trail as it is very short but well worth the small hike. 

Horner Park only has one way for traffic to flow so if you miss a place to park on the first round take another scenic drive and drive around again.
The cache is a small Lock-n-Lock container that has been well camouflaged and awaiting you to find it. Please put the cache back in the same place you find it. 

This park is a great park to have a picnic in and enjoy some light hiking, maybe even some fishing to pass the time or pull out a blanket and lay down and relax and smell the fresh air out in the country. 

Triplecnp_Cachers highly encourages CITO (Cache in/Trash out) and place our caches in places that this can be done to help keep our areas beautiful. 

Highly encourage adding pictures to this cache gallery of your fun times in this park.
Hint: Pretty obvious, but if you insist check a tree with a hole in the bottom.

DESC: Final stop in the Kamping Series
This is the final stop in our camping series, as you can see right across the street is our campground. You are looking for a small container and remember to bring your own pen/pencil and maybe something to retrieve the log with. This is the private campground we spend most of our summer weekends at there is great camping , and grerat fishing at a small lake. If you are a camper stop by the office and check out the camping rates,and if you are in the need of a new camper they sell them here too, you wont be sorry we have a lot of fun there, and if you see a blue and orange golf cart driving around thats us enjoying our wonderful day

2009-09-24 caverdon, After spending a few days of vacation in Missouri, our family decided to travel east ti Indiana for a while. Along the way we would stop occasionally and look for a cache. We left Missouri in the morning, and by evening we had arrived in Indianapolis. We found caches in three states during the day.

I stopped at this exit to stretch my legs and find a cache.  My family stayed in the car as it was raining.  But I would be not denied a cache!  

I searched very carefully for a while -- and it&apos;s a good thing I did, because there was a wasp nest within 10 feet of the cache and it was &quot;loaded up&quot;!  Fortunately those little critters stayed put and just kept an eye on me.  (Perhaps the rain was another factor.)  Then a short distance from there I came across a praying mantis, which was also checking me out.  And still no cache!  Anyway, all cachers should be careful around here for obvious reasons.

I soon found the cache.  As usual, I made it harder than it was -- which is more fun in the rain!  Don&apos;t knock it, try it.  [:D]  TFTC!

DESC: This is our first hidden cache.  Please let us know if you have problems with the coordinatres.
If you know anything about the area, you will get the title of this cache.  There are three strip clubs in DeSoto that I know of, and the building closest to the cache (now a trailer place) which was also one.  However, growing up, the road parrellel to the tracks and south of the cache, was called test strip road because of all of the samples of highway paint on the road.  Look for the cache in the brush row, not the prarie grasses.  Please secure the lid and rehide when finished.  Cache is a plastic green Folgers container with a pencil, log book, and a few small items.  Happy Caching!!!

DESC: A traditional kid-friendly cache placed in a nice secluded area that you can spend some time fishing or having a picnic.  Spend some extra time to relax after your find.
From Rt 159, go west on Reservoir Rd and follow the road as far back as you can go until you get to the Park Gate Entrance.  If the Park is open, you can follow the road all the way back to the Picnic area. You will have to then get out and walk by foot to get to the coordinates just a short distance away. The Park gate entrance is open from 7am until dusk.

This area is popular among the locals for fishing, so if you have some time, bring a pole and try drowning a few worms for awhile while you&apos;re here.

The cache is located at the beginning of a wooded trail, however, I have only walked the trail a short distance so I&apos;m not familiar where it actually takes you. Just be sure to mark the spot where your car is located if you decide to walk the trails, as they are unmarked and wind around quite a bit to other trails near the lake.

The cache is full of small trinkets and fun items for kids.  It also contains a small guest book for logging your entry. As always, please feel free to trade for any of the items in the cache.

If you have some extra time, take a short drive in town and visit some of the local Historical landmarks in our community.  See if you can guess what they are.

2009-11-29 jimlips, I love caches that are &quot;in the woods&quot;, yet have a nice trail/path/road right up to GZ.  Nice hide &amp; construction!  Beware of the sharp pokey-thorn-things on the container, though.

2009-09-07 Hobbit Taz, We missed the secret path when we first pulled up.  After turning around and heading to the otherside, I caught a glimps which appeared to be a mowed area between the trees.   We parked and took a look,  Cool - From this angle this little park is very well hidden with no markers.  cache was easier to spot than the way into the area.  TFTC.

Out Caching with CribbageWitch. We got a late start but headed for an area that we hadnt been into for sometime. We had a good start but kept running into caches that were on bike trails and we didnt bring the bikes. Looks like a future trip with bikes will be needed for this area.

&quot;M&apos; Was originally for the m &amp; m boys. mickey mantle &amp; roger maris,  two of baseball&apos;s all time greats.  they were true all stars. i will never forget the home run battle they had in 1961.  mickey played in the all star game 13 different years while roger played in it 4. 

&quot;During my 18 years I came to bat almost 10,000 times. I struck out about 1,700 times and walked maybe 1,800 times. You figure a ballplayer will average about 500 at-bats a season. That means I played 7 years without ever hitting the ball.&quot; - Mickey Mantle

This cache was placed on the spur of the moment with my daughter who has the &quot;caching bug&quot; really bad.  We had an extra contianer with us for repairs to another cache, but they were not needed.  We did not want to waste a perfectly good cache contianer so we found a nice spot in the park to hide this little one.   

This cache was inspired by a KidDylan cache and should be easy, only a 2 because of muggle activity.

Hope you enjoy it.

But I liked the first two places I went today (Washington COunty Nature Preserve and Washington County Conservation Area) I spent all day there and just found 3 caches. I had a really great time and got to do some hiking in really nice areas.  I also got to GPS a bunch of stuff for my trail  map.  So thnaks for the outstanding caches!  One thing I liked aobut both places was they are obviously regualarly burned and I did not see many invassive and some very high forest.  I get so tired of seeing the invassive jungles around the STL area.

I did not know about this place.  But I really liked the flatwoods.  Very nice!  I hiked all the trails.

DESC: This cache is located on one of the MCT Trails that runs along Old Troy Road.
This cache was placed in memory of the day I met my wife on this very bike trail.  It was just supposed to be a simple bike ride and 2 years later we are married because of our bike ride that day.  The exact spot of the cache is where she had the nerve, on a mountain bike, to take off and yell, &quot;Let&apos;s race back!&quot;   Being the gentleman I was, my road bike blew by her, but I did come back to finish the race with her...chivalry is not dead.   :)

The cache is a micro, camo painted, and should be a very easy grab, all I ask is that you cover it back up and replace it as you found it.  

NOTE:  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO NEED TO CLIMB THE ROCKS.   See hint below.
Hint: Located in the Rocks along the trail.  Look along first row of rocks...no need to climb.

2009-10-18 L Frank, Denmother and I were OCW Strider, Crowesfeat30, and quailman2 after Cache Slash Fest. We went looking for the cache, and CF30 spotted a cornsnake. Strider caught it and took some pictures. While we were admiring it, quailman2 found the cache and signed as SLAGA 6. We let the snake go and continued down the road. Thanks, mike_anderson1492, for the cache.

We were dove hunting here but instead Sarah &amp; Susie found a beautiful young corn snake for me to catch. A very nice one too, it never tried to bite me even. I held it for a few minutes, then released it nearby. The cache was a little harder to find. Thanks Jim,

SIZE: Regular
D1.5/T4.5
DESC: The most challenging Cache in our area hands down!
The-Lost-Boys are hardcore fans of the hit ABC show LOST. 

This cache was placed trying to recreate what it would be like to be on this show.This is the hardest find/terrain we could think of.  Not a family fun search, this is for the most hardcore finders out there. Placed in a secluded forest between two neighborhoods, you may want to wear old clothes and long sleaves and long pants because the trails are over grown. Like I said this is a craziest cache we could think of. We suggest not parking on the Lakeshire side, it doubles the terrain level. We placed it during the night if you can believe it haha.

You&apos;re a man of science, I&apos;m a man of faith...But a GPS is a must on this cache! 

Trading cache decently large but no bigger than a bucket. 
Please replace well hidden in same spot with the lid well shut.
We will check on this often, please leave comments if something is wrong.

This is our first cache, Namaste and Good Luck!

I found the path to the cache real easy in the daylight.  I was expecting a much harder time getting to to this one.  I would suggest changing the terrian rating to a 2.  This is definately not a 4.5 and that rating is likely scaring people away from a great cache.  It was a nice walk and I used the zip line.  Thanks for a fun cache and easy find.

Had to remove a fallen tree from the zip line first.  Excellent job!  And I have no idea how it got there either, but I know it was a LONG TIME ago.

DESC: An off the trail adventure
A nice long hunt off of my favorite trail in the area. The opening of the trail starts behind the old Kinsella House in Pleasant Ridge Park in Fairview. The cache is about a quarter mile in so i recommend doing this in the middle of the day. The trail can be over grown at sometimes so the fall is the best time to search this one out. Not too bad of terrain except for the hills and having to cross a creek, but there are man made bridges and steps and a map on the trail. Stay to the right at first big fork.

Small trading cache  with log, full of neat nick nacks.
Please replace lid tight and hide in same spot.

Namaste and Good Luck

2009-09-27 beladi1, Beautiful day for a hike.  Enjoyed walking through the woods.  When I got to groundzero, I was at this very cool tree on the bank of the creek.  Search all around, but no luck.  I heard this crashing through the woods and heavy breathing.  I froze where I was.  All of a sudden a big dog jumped across the creek and up the bank continuing on through the woods.  I am sure glad he was not hunting me.  

Since I could not locate the cache and I had not crossed the creek yet, I tried on the other side.  There was the clue and the cache too.  The cache was not covered up.  As I was signing the log 2 muggles were walking along the creek.  They walked right over to me to see what I was doing.  I talked to them a little about caching.  They were very nice and helped me back across the creek.

What a busy place this is in the middle of the woods.  My gps had a reading that was about 40ft off.  Thanks for the great adventure.  [:)]

The magnet is still up there with some old glue on it, but a search of the area did not reveal the fallen cache.  Sorry.  Can I still claim it?  If you don&apos;t want me to, just delete my log.   FTF....uhhh....magnet.  No, I did leave the magnet there.  LOL

I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be back this way again soon.

I had some trouble finding this one and called a previous finder for a hint. Just as he was about to give it away I put my hand right on the cache.

As has been mentioned before, the cache has been very wet and the logsheet was a soaked wad of paper. I replaced it with a sheet of National Geographic Adventure Paper which should stand up against the elements pretty well.

Sigh...I had hoped for a much better day of caching. However, I got started two hours later than I had anticipated. So, with a half hour until sundown, I headed out to find a couple caches. This was my first.

My FAVORITE Jasper County town! Lots of beautiful trees in this
park, nice picnic areas, tennis &amp;amp;  basketball courts, a good
playground area, canoe ramp access, batting cages &amp;amp;  miniature
golf course. Most recently they are working on a new aquatic center
that should be open summer of 2010. Uptown there&apos;s a great museum
in the back of the public library. Few miles east is Sam Parr State
Park with great camping facilities. A few miles southwest is
Stone&apos;s Throw public golf course. Enjoy our hometown!!!

Denmother and I were standing there talking with them when we heard &quot;Found it.&quot; We all walked in to sign the log. That&apos;s when we noticed all the decoys.

We had a really nice time here. When we parked here, we saw 2 4-wheelers parked near the shed. We thought maybe we were disturbing some hunters, but it was 2 local cachers who had found some of the decoys but not Not. We talked with them and then Jim of Quailman2 found the cache, In pretty good time too. I still hadn&apos;t found a decoy even. We then talked with our new friends for a few more minutes before moving on. Thanks SidewaysSam,

This is the town that gramps grew up in so we wanted to make this
one special! A little more difficult than the rest in this
series.... but they can&apos;t ALL be park and grabs! However, this
cache IS handicap accessible. Please replace the cache exactly as
it was! Thanks. The beautiful building on these grounds used to be
the Sacred Heart Novitiate where priests and brothers were trained
by the Catholic Church. Later, when the numbers dropped, this
building was used by the school unit. Again, later it was closed
for that purpose and the offices are currently being used by the
administration of So. Eastern Special Ed. The community of Ste.
Marie uses the pool that is a the north part of the
grounds.

Just for fun I may have called out &quot;Its a micro on a tree&quot; as they crossed the ditch.  I think they had about the same reaction they did when they found it.  I had to go have a second look.  You really went all out.  I remember you telling about all the time you put into this.  The night friendly feature seems to have an issue.

2009-10-18 JanS03, Heading home after Lake_Wannabees and I spent a fun day at the Cache Slash Fest and caching in the Sumner area yesterday.  We spent the night in Flora and did a few caches in Flora to warm up, them headed to Vincennes and cached westward as we made our way home.   This has to be the coolest cache container I&apos;ve ever seen!  I loved it!  Thanks!

2009-10-18 lake_wannabees, This was one of the three new CSF caches that we found today.  It was our first time and there were so many cahes that we just went caching yesterday instead of looking for these.  I had this one in my NUVI and GPS but not the blackberry so had to be creative in documenting the find.  Glad to see that there are pics for this one.  Number 33 of 52 today.

DO NOT drive across the grassy area to this cache - even though some idiots have already been cutting donuts in the grass.  Of course cachers are kind and considerate to the areas they visit.....

This cache features Rite in the Rain paper for the log.

2009-10-17 BlueBeadMan, Caching and camping with 2_cats, her daughter, and this time Lancelot.  We found several caches on our way to the last Cache Slash Fest and this was one of our finds.  I think I found 51 caches this weekend--that is, after getting my truck UNstuck at the campground.  At least, my truck carried us to all of our cache finds!  Thanks!

 <desc>A Reel Big Fish Story Cache...a WHOPPER of a micro by Eagle1977
Cache ID: GCY8FV
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Micro
D2.5/T2.5
DESC: This is a 35mm canister located in Stephen Forbes State Park.
Parking is available (you can&apos;t miss it). The straight shot may be the best depending on athletic ability, weather, etc. The difficulty is for the size and opportunity for hiding though it has been pared back due to my experience in Wyoming and the notion that no terrain in Southern Illinois is over a 3. Please watch for hidden holes and ankle-twisters
Twenty some odd years ago, my grandfather and I went fishing at Forbes Lake whenever we could. (Illinois Department of Natural Resources Disclaimer: Geocache is placed on Department managed property with permission.
Do not place the following items in the Geocache: Food items, inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials. It is the visitors responsibility or orient themselves with policies and rules pertaining to this Department managed site.)

One summer morning, while fishing and leaning over the concrete wall (no fence then), I hooked a leviathon. I almost ended up in the gully below. My grandfather helped me reel it in and then he dragged my tiny five year old frame, both our fishing rods, a tacklebox, and a five gallon bucket full of a fish up the embankment. When you see the climb, you&apos;ll be impressed by this tale. I wanted to keep the fish alive for my parents to see that evening so I spent the better part of the day in my cowboy boots and plaid shirt sitting on a stump blowing bubbles through a
plastic hose into the bucket. That evening, my dad weighed the lunker and took a great picture of my 15 ounce hybrid sunfish.

And then it disappeared. Only later did I understand that we were eating fried Moby Dick for dinner. My fish tale may be a little bit long but my catch was much bigger than my cache. Since he could have swallowed a 35mm film container, do not leave any trinkets no matter how small. Also, this is a seed from the One Degree of Separation caching project. For more information, go to: geoonedegree.proboards51.com. For fun, add your own whopper of a story as a note or in your log... we&apos;ll see who can one-up some cacher tales.

2008-02-23 MutherAndSun, TFTC Eagle1977!  I was afraid this would be the one that got away today.  There were so many places to look and a nice cover of snow, that I had my doubts.  I was taking the Delorme out on its maiden voyage and didn&apos;t want to let it down.  Well it did take me right to the cache, although I just didn&apos;t know it for about 10 minutes while searching the wrong places on the treacherously slick rocks.  Luckily I was able to reel this one in and most of the others in this beautiful park today.

2007-06-02 roelsch, Geocaching with Mean Gene and The Rooter on the first weekend in June, a return to Salem. We tried to get here from the fish hatchery, but got within 0.25 miles before decided there had to be a better way. We found the better way and lots of parking, then took the obvious path by the spillway. We got lucky and Mean Gene found it in the first place he seriously looked. TNLNSL. Thanks, Eagle1977! -- roelsch, St. Charles, MO
Found it
2007-06-02 Mean Gene, Caching with Roelsch on a muggy day in central Illinois.  Streets and Trips had us coming in from the southeast but that was incorrect unless we wanted to do it on foot.  We eventually got there by car and headed down.  There were lots of possible hiding spots but I found it in almost the first place I looked by pure luck and judicious poking with my rooting pole.  The log was curiously damp.  Good job.  Thanks, Eagle1977, for placing this cache. – Mean Gene and the Rooter, St. Louis MO
