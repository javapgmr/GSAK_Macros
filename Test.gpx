SIZE: Small

DESC: Explore the new trails being developed by Queensbury near Halfway Brook
Though a work in process as of now, the town has cleared and marked some paths through the meadow and woods east of Meadowbrook Road.  This multicache will lead you along a loop that we&apos;ve found.  Final is a camoed pill bottle large enough for small trade items.  Reception is variable under the trees.  Waterproof boots would be helpful, particularly if it has rained recently.  Should be accessible in winter until deep snows arrive.  No formal trailhead yet; look for a sawhorse at about N43 20.790 W73 38.698.

2009-12-05 trav6595, Well once again we went out for one of those late night FTF&apos;s. The trails here are deffinately a work in progress but its a great area for them. All the coords were dead on and the hides were great! We had some trouble at the third stop and it sounded like somebody off in the distance was having trouble as well...(alot of yelling). Anyways we blocked out the domestic disturbance and headed onward to finish out the loop of the trail. TFTC!!

Oh and surprisingly I got back to the car with toasty warm, dry feet....must have just taken the right paths. I would recomend some good boots for this one!

2009-11-02 Richard E, A nice walk along the feeder. I had to look real good. Thanks
Found it
2009-11-01 scubakings, Wow, this was one of the most difficult caches I have come across in awhile!  When I did finally spot the cache, I had a little difficulty getting my hands on it.  Kudos to CO for placing one that made us all think and search hard.
Found it
2009-10-29 NYhiker, This was another tricky one to end our afternoon of caching along the river and canal.  As we approached the GZ someone was walking around the area, and fortunately turned out to be a fellow cacher - nice to meet you!  So the three of us walked around and around the area for quite a while, stopping to reread the cache info at times.  Finally my able assistant found it and called me in for help.  Coords are good, as is the difficulty rating.  TNLNSL; thanks for the challenge and hide!

PS - the best parking is probably at the Shermantown Road access to the canal trail, though we parked off the road closer by and braved using the canal trail crossing (didn&apos;t challenge anyone to stop for us in the crosswalk though).
Didn&apos;t find it
2009-10-29 scubakings, No luck for me today.  Only had about 30 minutes and I did feel kinda conspicuous searching with the constuction going on and cars at a standstill.  I  also had difficulty figuring out where I should park. Ended up down by PlowBoy 1 but I think my car was on private property.  I&apos;ll be back to seach some more.

2009-10-28 Oxyperious, After staring at the vines and fence for almost an hour yesterday, I called in the reinforcements.  RACnLa, JoeB46er &amp; I met at the parking area and walked to GZ.  I remained blind but Joe soon saw what he needed to see.  Very clever hide.
Found it
2009-10-28 racnla, &apos;Ol Eagle eyes Joe worked GZ while Oxy and I spread out to search the perimeter, Joe made the find
right at the posted coords.  Good hide!
Found it
2009-10-28 Joe B 46er, Headed out this rainy morning with Oxperious and RACnLa ... we work well together and made the find within 15 minutes. The coords are right on and it is an excellent hide. The weather must have kept the muggles away ... we had GZ all to ourselves. Glad Rick (RAC) didn&apos;t have to go for the swim in the canal! TFTC

2009-10-26 cj-man, YES FTF!! 
Better pay attention to the name I was there a good half hour and was just about to give up when alas it appeared right in front of me.

Cache ID: GC20MP6
Traditional Cache
SIZE: Regular
D2/T3
DESC: A regular cache overlooking Rush Pond.
I&apos;ve been enjoying exploring these trails and I came across a site that screamed &quot;Hide a cache here!&quot;, so I did.  I&apos;m excited about the new containers I&apos;ve found [see picture].  It is a stainless cylinder 8&apos; high and 4.5&apos; across.  The latch is like an ammo can but not quite as sturdy.  Other that the catch, I think these will be as trouble free as an ammo can and I like the size.

Access from the north can be gained through a town lot on West Mountain Rd.  There is parking for 1 car.  Others will want to park at Gurney Ln &amp; West Mountain and walk to the access.  Next to a new house, look for survey stakes with blue ribbons.  Sides of the stakes tell you the left side is town property.  At the back of the lot, the trail should be obvious.

2009-11-19 mojim, Found while out with NYhiker and scubaking and George...but not the rest of the mojim team.  Will have to come back again with them!
Took the Scooby TB since that&apos;s Gen&apos;s favorite show for the past year!  Nice day for a walk in the woods.
Found it
2009-11-19 NYhiker, First stop today with an ADK-Geocaching group.  Good hide, but found quickly with so many looking together.  Swapped some TBs; left Herbie Hears No Evil and picked up Broxie Coin.  Enjoyed the company and the hike, TFTC!

2009-11-08 Joe B 46er, Had no trouble following trails in from road ... took me a little longer than it should have to find this one ... if you know the way Richard E hides caches, then you&apos;ll know what to look for on this one. Discovered a couple of TBs ... SL for my cache of the day and had a nice walk back to the car. TFTC

2009-11-07 LG139, Another fine cache in this terrific area. Only problem seems to be accessability to trails. Took geocoin. Left $2 US bill. SL TFTC

2009-11-05 Richard E, Quick find using yet another short cut I found, but not quick enough.  This is a great container. Hope it works out. Thanks
Found it
2009-11-05 scubakings, Saw this pop up bright and early this am and called a friend who lives on West Mountain Road and we were off.  Nice moring to be out.  Trails nice, no need to bushwack.  Found with a short search.  I&apos;m working up to a hide Oxy- might have to come back here again to place one!  Grabbed Oxmazing TB.  
My friend found a tick on her jacket so beware, they are still out.
